Dogs really are a mans best friend, as one police officer found out recently.
Officer Todd Frazier was looking into a suspiciously parked car in Hancock County, Mississippi when three men attacked him.
He started to fear for his life when the trio dragged him into the woods, however luckily for him help was at hand in the form of a four legged hero.
During his ordeal officer Frazier managed to free one hand and press abutton which remotely opened the door of his car, releasing Lucas the police dog.
Lucas immediately realised his colleague was in danger and bit one of his attackers, before chasing the gang off.
They told him they were going to slit his throat, and they were dragging him toward the woods, said chief deputy Don Bass.

Due to Lucas heroic intervention officer Frazier was only taken to hospital for minor injuries and released shortly after.
The attackers, who police believe may have been connected to local gangs, are still at large after fleeing the scene in the very car Frazier was investigating.
Chief deputy Don told the Clarion-Ledger : The main thing for anybody is to go home safe, we want you to go home at night.

Google is set to introduce a new buy button (Picture: Getty Images)
Youll soon be able to buy things straight from Google with a special button.
The search giant confirmed it was introducing the new option at a conference in California yesterday, with the move being seen as a way to counter the threat of Amazon.
Its internet rival has seen searches for products through its website rise, which could negatively affect Google traffic.
Theres going to be a buy button. Its going to be imminent, said Googles chief business officer, Omid Kordestani.

The new button would work by allowing users to buy products on shopping adverts that accompanied search results, which earn Google money.
With Google Buy set to only be available on mobile devices and the search giant recently changing its algorithm to favour mobile optimised sites, its clear Google believes that smartphones and tablets are the way forward for e-commerce, Worldpay eCommerces Kevin Dallas told the BBC .

Uefa has not ruled out the possibility of a World Cup boycott by European countries if Sepp Blatter wins the upcoming Fifa presidential election.
The international governing body is currently embroiled in a corruption scandal after seven of the most powerful figures in global football were arrested on Wednesday as part of a US investigation.
But Mr Blatter has so far refused to resign and said today the allegations against Fifa bought shame and humiliation to football.

But Uefa president Michel Platini has refused to rule out a boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, despiteFA vice-chairman David Gill saying it would be wrong to make the fans suffer.
Thats a discussion to be had by everyone in Uefa, Gill said.
All the options will be looked at but ultimately its for the fans.

Renaud Prudhomme wanted to break the world record (Picture: Getty Images)
A French barman has been convicted of manslaughter after a customer drank 56 shot and died as a result.
Renaud Prudhomme, 56, was attempting to break the world record for the number of shots drunk in one sitting at Le Starter, a bar in Clermont-Ferrand in central France, in October.
When he died the next day in hospital, 47-year-old barman Gilles Crepin, who served Mr. Prudhomme the drinks, was arrested and charged with manslaughter for a clearly deliberate violation of safety and prudence.
Mr. Crepin, who admitted he encouraged Mr. Prudhomme by displaying the shots record on a blackboard,was given a four-month suspended sentence and was banned from working in a bar for a year.
Mr. Crepin admitted he encouraged the drinking (Picture: Google)
But his lawyer said they will appeal the decision.
Its a decision guided by emotion and the unconscious desire to set an example, he said, adding that Mr. Prudhomme suffered from existing respiratory and alcohol abuse problems.
We cant ask every customer who buys alcohol to present their medical certificates, he said.
Antoine Portal, who represented the family of Mr Prudhomme, said they were relieved to hear Mr. Crepin would no longer be working as a bartender.

Ordinary pubs have no chance to survive in a village like this, saidMartin Povysil, a local homebrewer who installed the machine.
Normal pubs open in the evenings and at weekends but they are mostly closed during the day, leaving your tourist or cyclist dry.

Warning: Strong language
Roads can be scary places, especially when drivers are getting head-butted by motorcyclists.
To be fair this motorbike rider had reason to be angry after his friend (and fellow rider) was nearly run off the road by the white truck.
But violence is never the answer, and the fact the driver had his kids and partner in the vehicle when he was assaulted made the incident worse.

He really felt that headbutt (Picture: YouTube)
The YouTube clip, titled daniels headset full video, showed the rider (with a head camera) narrowly avoiding the white truck thatseemed to be aiming for him.
Both vehicles then doubled back, with the driver stepping out to confront the motorcyclist when they eventually met up.
This was a big mistake as his mate was behind him and proceeded to headbutt the man in the face, who then fell to the floor.
Both the driver and his partner were visibly shaken and decided tomake an exit after a brief argument.
But the story wasnt over, and at the end of the clip it showed the driver throwing something at the bikers when he saw them the next day.

The bolt went through his head and out of his back (Picture: Heather Cross)
Were sure your parents told you never to stand under a tree duringa thunderstorm.
A 34-year-old man from Nampa, Idaho, just showed why.
Ryan Cross defied odds of one in 500,000 when a lightning bolt struck him in the back of the head and passed out through his back, KTVB reports.
According to Mr. Crossswife Heather,the pair were away on a camping trip with friends, and hewas riding a quad bike when it started to rain.
Soon, the rain turned to hail and Mr. Cross got off his bike and leaned against a tree to protect himself. Then a lightning bolt struck.
The bolt hit Mr. Cross and the two friends he was with. One of the friends remembersan intense ringing in his ears, while the other, who had one foot on the ground and one over his dirt bike, was hit indirectly in the leg.

Neither of Mr. Crosssfriends wereseriously harmed, buthe was rushed to hospital, where doctors found he had bleeding on the brain and a thick, bolt-shaped burn down the centre of his torso.
His clothes had been shredded by the lightning strike and were still hot to the touch, Mrs. Cross said.
Storms grow quickly and come on you quickly in the mountains, KTVB meteorologist Larry Gebert said.
Storms develop so fast and based on the ruggedness of the mountains you cant see it coming. The best thing to do in a storm, when you have no protection is to be the smallest thing out there.
Mr. Gebert advises getting low to the ground and protecting yourself from the rain and hail as best you can.
Mr. Cross is now alert and eating. The long-term implications of the strike arent yet known, but he appears to berecovering well.

The cow finally stopped near a McDonalds (Picture: Eric Berting/Twitter)
A cow that made a daring bid for freedom when it escaped from a slaughterhouse was tracked down and shot near a McDonalds.
Perhaps in the hope ofearning the kind of fame affordedto this pair of llamas , the cow and two others fled Tri State Beef Co. in Cincinnati at around 11am yesterday.
Two were quickly rounded up, but one briefly shook off Tri State Beef Co. employees and headed west along a main road, to the bewilderment of drivers.

Slaughterhouseemployees headed after the cow, and it eventually stoppednear theMcDonalds on Harrison Avenue. It rushed one of the employees, who shot it twice with his rifle, witnesses said.
The man who put the cow down, it was so close it actually fell on his leg and he seemed to be limping but he refused medical at the time, Sergeant Stephen Meyer of Cincinnati Police Department, told WLWT .
In a bizarre coincidence, a pig on the other side of the city escaped a farm and was found wandering through the streets.
Officer Byron Wilber said the pig and one of his colleagues had a short scuffle before it was subdued.

Do you remember when goldfish used to be given away as prizes to children at fairs, despite the very realpossibility that the child would drop it on the way home, wouldnt have a tank to put it in or would simply be negligent?
Clearly, some people have very little regard for the humble goldfish.
Not this person.
Reddit user leability built what he callsa goldfish wheelchair for a fishthat was having trouble staying upright.
The wheelchair consists of a tape or bandage wrapped around the underside of the fish and attached to a cork, which functions as a floating device.
If the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated, as Mahatma Gandhi famously claimed, then the home of leability and his disabled fish must be some sortof utopia.

1 in 5 catfish parents have made a fake social media account to spy on theirkids
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Thursday 28 May 2015 10:42 am

One in five UK parents have made a fake social media account to spy on their kids, a new survey has revealed.
The research byVoucherCodesPro.co.uk also found that 63 per cent of parents who use sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have had their profiles blocked by their offspring.
A total of 2,627 British parents aged 30 and over with at least one child between the ages of 13 to 18 took part in the survey.
Theywere initially questioned on their own use of social media platforms, with more thanthree quarters of parents polled stating that they have at least one social media page.
Parents on social media
Twitter (54%)
Instagram (33%)
Next, participants were asked if they had ever set up a fake profile in order to spy on their childrens accounts  and 21 per cent revealed they had done so.
Of the relevant catfish parents, 47 per cent admitted that theyd been found out by their children regarding their deceit. Whats more, only two per cent disclosed to researchers that they had discovered something worrying about their children through social media.
Nick Swan, CEO and Founder of VoucherCodesPro.co.uk said the following regarding the findings: Whilst its completely normal for parents to care for and protect their children from harm at any cost, the potential consequences of spying on your child through these deceitful means is potential very damaging for your relationship with them.
These days it is completely normal for teenagers to spend a large proportion of their spare time online and there are certainly better ways to ensure your childs online safety than by creating fake online profiles.

But lets focus on the important things.
The man jumped over (some how) and confronted the female bear at a zoo in Warsaw, Poland.
He then proceeded to stuff his arm into her mouth  and then smack her on the head when she bit down.

It turns out that an alarming amount of French people dont shower every day *crinkles nose in disgust*.
More than 40 per cent dont regularly clean themselves, according to a new poll of French peoples habits.
A further 24 per centsaidthey shower once every two days, and11 per cent said they showered once every three days.
The remaining eightper cent only cleanevery four days. Ewww.
The average French person spends nine minutes in the shower when they actually get round to taking one.
Virginia Mallet, head of hygiene company Initial France told French daily Le Figaro: In France, we have a hard time admitting that poor hygiene is a factor linked to illness.
The simple act of washing ones hands after going to the toilet is automatic in some countries, but in France we have always underestimated this act.

A man who took his cat out on a canoeing trip died when it jumped into the water and he dived in to save it.
William Anderson, 46, was canoeing with two friends and his cat on Loon Lake, north of Chicago, Illinois, when the cat leaptinto the water.
Mr. Anderson immediately dived in after it, flipping the canoe and sending his two friends into the water with him. People on a nearby pontoon boat spotted the capsized canoe and managed to rescue the cat and the two friends. Mr. Anderson, however, did not survive.
Police say that alcohol may have been a factor in the death, the Chicago Tribune reports.
The Illinois Department of Natural Resources is investigating the death.

Yes, lions arethe kings of the jungle, but this one stillcant for the life of him get his head out of a barrel.
Keepers at Dierenrijk Zoo in the Netherlands thought it might be entertaining for their trio of young lions if they were given their meal inside a barrel for a change.
Unfortunately, one of the lions got his head stuck inside it and spent the next two-and-a-half minutes running around, frantically trying to get it off.
He didnt succeed. And though it was probably frustratingfor the lion, a zookeeper managed to cut it off with a few minutes with no harm done.

A teenage boy survived 42 minutes underwater in what was heralded as an exception event by doctors.
The unnamed boy, 14, jumped into the Naviglio Canal from a bridge in the town of Cuggiono, west ofMilan, Italy, at 4:53pmon 24 April, The Local reports.
When theteenager failed to come up to the surface, the friends he was with frantically searched the murky water, and called emergency services when they couldnt find him.
A team of divers was dispatched and they finally pulled the 14-year-olds body from the water at 5:32pm, 42 minutes after he had gone under.
He was rushed by helicopter to Milans San Raffaele hospital, where doctors treated him using Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, a procedure whereby an artificial lung outside the body is used to pump oxygenated blood through it.

Incredibly, the boy had made a full recovery within ten days. He had to have his right leg amputated below the knee due to circulation problems, however.
[The recovery was] an exceptional event, said Alberto Zangrillo, director of Anaesthesia and Resuscitation at San Raffaele.
The kind that makes us think that some parameters regarding survival in a state of hypoxia [reduced oxygen supply to the body] must be revised.
Dr. Zangrillo credits the determination of the paramedics who were in the air ambulance with the teenager, and who continued to try and resuscitate him all the way to the hospital.
The boys mother told La Stampa his recovery was miraculous. His father thanked the professionalism of the hospital staff.

Its not quite Old Man and the Sea, but one fisherman had to summon up resources he didnt know he had in order to reel in a record-breaking 65lb bass.
Lawrence Dillman, of Rockaway Beach in Missouri, fought the giant bassfor 45 minutes with a 20lb line and a minnow before wading inand bear-hugging the fish out of the water and onto the bank.
The bass, caught on Bull Shoals Lake near the Arkansas border, weighed in at 65lbs 2oz and was more than 49in in length, beating the previous record size of 60lbs 9oz.

Ive caught bigger fish in the ocean, but this fish is the biggest fresh-water fish I have ever caught.

Dating apps are leading to more casual sex (Picture: Getty Images)
Dating apps such as Tinder and Grindr are leading to a rise in syphillis, gonorrhoea, HIV and other sexually-transmitted diseases, health experts warn.
The Rhode Island Department of Health saidrates of sexually-transmitted diseases have increased in the recentyears as a result of therise in casual or anonymous sexual encounters,sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs  which lower the immune system  and sex without the use of a condom.
Expertssay that dating apps, which allow users to arrange casual encounters, are partly to blame.

Gay and bisexual men are most at risk (Picture: Grindr)
The Rhode Island Department of Health found that from 2013 to 2014, cases of syphilis rose by 79 percent, gonorrhoea rose by 30 percent and HIV rose by 33 percent in the state, and expertsthat this trend is reflected across the US.
These data send a clear signal that despite the progress we have made in reducing STDs and HIV over the years, there is more work to do, said Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the department.
Gay and bisexual men are most at risk, department officials say, as cases of HIV and infectious diseases are increasing at a faster rate among them than in the heterosexual population.
Rosemary Reilly-Chammat, an HIV and Aids specialist, told MailOnline that young people should speak to a medical professional before and after becoming sexually active.

These new data underscore the importance of encouraging young people to begin talking to a doctor, nurse, or health educator about sexual health before becoming sexually active and especially after becoming sexually active, she said.
Dr. Rosemary Gillespie of the UK-based Terrence Higgins Trust added: Dating apps have given people more opportunities to meet potential partners than ever before, and we are currently looking at their impact on gay mens sexual health.
In the meantime, it is really important that the safer sex message stays strong, and that people know how to protect themselves and their partners.

A company which produces hearing aids has caused outrage recently after one of their advertscontained the phrase: Hearing aids can be ugly.
The advert, from Victorian Hearing in Australia, has been accused of adding to the prejudice against hearing aid users.
Going off the statistic that 20 per cent of Australians with hearing problems do not wear hearing aids because they are embarrassed, the advert was intended to promote Victorian Hearings new invisible hearing aids.
The advert was quickly taken down after the company received several negative comments on their Facebook page.

A set of photographs has been discovered depicting some of the earliest examples of brain surgery.
The eerie images were found in a disused basement of Yale University in Connecticut, which also happened to contain hundred of brains preserved in jars of formaldehyde.
It was determined that the collection of images belonged to pioneering brain surgeon Dr Harvey Cushing, who left the his impressive collection of photos and patients brains to the university upon his death in 1939.
The photos show several different patients either before or after brain surgery, yet most of their identities are unknown.

Many of the photos show patients holding their right hand over their chest  this was done because physicians at the time believed hand condition (size, pigmentation etc)was related to health.
While Cushing would go on to be known as the father of brain surgery, it is not knownhow the patients featured in these images fared after their procedures.

Common mental health problems could be treated by LSD and magic mushrooms, says a leading psychiatrist.
But legal restrictions makes testing the drugs forany potential benefits extremely hard.
Writing in the BMJ, James Rucker, lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry, said research was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s which indicated some positive impacts LSD and shrooms had on psychiatric cases.
But the drugs were outlawed and classed as doing more harm than good in a medical sense so experiments immediately halted.
DrRucker writes: No evidence indicates that psychedelic drugs are habit forming; little evidence indicates that they are harmful in controlled settings; and much historical evidence shows that they could have use in common psychiatric disorders.
Only four hospitals in the UK hold a license to store schedule 1 drugs. They come with a price tag of 5,000 which makes research five times as expensive.

The world is bracing for its hottest year on record.
Globally, the average temperature has been0.68C above average from January to April  the highest ever.
Already this year temperature records have been smashed in Antarctica,Guinea, Ghana, Venezuela and Laos.
According to The Times, Professor Adam Scaife, who leads the monthly to decadal climate prediction research at the Met Office, said: Theres a pretty good chance of the global record being broken this year.
Last December we forecast that this year would set a new record, around 0.64C above the norm, and global temperatures are higher so far this year than at this stage in 2014.
El Nino - what is it?
El Nino is warming of the Pacific Ocean
Usually easterly winds blow warm waters towards thewest Pacific with cold water welling up around the coast of South America
But El Nino forms when temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific are at least half a degree higher than normal for several months
A wave of warm water is formed over several months and pushed back east
This process warms up the atmosphere and has a big impact on weather around the world
Scientists are pointing to the El Nino formed earlier this year.
The weather patterncan lead to less droughts in India and less rainfall in the tropics.
The process can warm up the Earths atmosphere  but it can mean much more bitter winters.

Bit awkward for Volvo.
One of their new cars was beingtested for the pedestrian detection feature when it rammed into someone.
The XC60 is seen reversing in a Dominican Republic car park.
The driver is believed to haveaccelerated forwards and the car is seen smashing into a bloke with his hands in his pockets.

It left two men with bruising and minor injuries.
The car giant said the people who bought the Volvo did not pay for the pedestrian detection functionality.
Spokesman Johan Larsson said: The Volvo XC60 comes with City Safety as a standard feature however this does not include the Pedestrian detection functionality.
It appears as if the car in this video is not equipped with Pedestrian detection. This is sold as a separate package.
Good to know.

This car was being driven by a human being. Moreover, this vehicle was not fitted with Pedestrian Detection, a Volvo safety system designed to identify pedestrians and apply a vehicles brakes.

Instead, this vehicle was fitted with a feature called City Safety, which is standard in all Volvos.

This system contributes to safer driving in heavy city traffic by avoiding or mitigating rear end collisions with other vehicles in low speeds by braking.

There was nothing wrong with the car itself. The unfortunate incident happened only due to human error.

How was your first poo of the day? Because if you can match the consistency to some of these, you might need to see a doctor.
According to researchers, there are seven types of stool  from the slow hard push to the rapid squirt.
Some time ago the Bristol Royal Infirmary came up with a visual guide known as the Bristol Stool Scale (below is our own interpretation).
Types 3 and 4 are considered healthy. Experiencing any other type on a regular basis is good grounds to consult your GP.

        <Description>The offshore rigs would be built or moved to places most in need of food, and would harvest solar power and fish in addition to crops.</Description>

The Smart Floating Farm is the brainchild of Javier Ponce and Jakup Dycha (Picture: Caters)
The first designsof offshore floating farms have been released and their creators believe they could be the solution to the growing food demand as the worldpopulation rises.
It is estimated that by 2050 the global population will hit 9.1billion, which willin turn create an increase in the demand for food by around 70 percent.
To prevent a potential food scarcity crisis, futurists, artists and engineers have proposed various solutions fromvertical city farms to precision agriculture and genetically-modified crops.
MORE: This is what London will look like in the near future, experts say
A bold set of designs showsanother solution: floating farms.
Architect Javier Ponce and Jakup Dycha, who created the Smart Floating Farm (SFF) concept, are proposing the use of buoyant offshorerigs to farm, which have the advantage over their vertical city equivalentin that they take up no land space and can harvest fish as well as crops.
These farms would would be built or moved toplacesmost in need of food, and would have a three-tier design, with the bottom level responsible for fishing and storage, the second level responsiblefor crops and the third level holdingsolar panels to power the rig.
MORE: Dogs will become too expensive in the future and well have to buy robo-pets
Facing the current challenges of cities growing, land consumption and climate change, I believe projects like the Smart Floating Farms can help change some of the existing practices, Mr. Ponce said.
These practices have led us to the present situation and open new possibilities which can improve the quality of human life and the environment.
Based on a floating multi-layered strategy, which combines aquaculture (fish), hydroponics (crops) and photovoltaics (solar power), we aim that these floating farms can be located close to areas where food is more needed and potentially become automated farm clusters run by the use of software.

Adult film producers are concerned the new regulations will force them out of state or underground (Picture: REX Shutterstock)
We dont know if theres such a thing as goggles porn, but if there isnt, there mightbe soon.
New state proposals in California would have all porn actors and actresses wear protective eye gear during shoots (pun intended, and we apologise) as part of an attempt to reduce the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases within the industry.
The 21-page draft calls for condoms and other barriers  including the eye gear  to be used in all sex scenes. It also requires producers to pay for medical visits and hepatitis B vaccines for adult film performers, the Los Angeles Daily News reports.

Diane Duke of the Free Speech coalition called the regulations unworkable (Picture: REX Shutterstock)
These are regulations designed for medical settings, and are unworkable on an adult film set  or even a Hollywood film set, said Diane Duke, the CEO of the Free Speech coalition.
There are concerns within the industry that excessive regulation willdamage business andforce directors and producers underground or out of state.
The proposals follow a letter sent by Michael Weinstein of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation to the state agency which complained that poor enforcement and vague wording was allowing adult film producers to circumvent currentrules requiring actors to wear condoms.

Children have become adept at conversing through the use of emojis,often usingthem a playful and concise way to express themselves.
This is why a Swedishcharitycalled BRIS have come up with the app Abused Emojis.
Rather than the usual cheerful faces and humorous icons, BRIS have created a set of emojis which show sad or abused children.
Normally, emojis are happy and joyful. But if youve been hurt, mistreated or feel sad, theres no emojis to represent those feelings, a BRIS spokesperson said.
MORE: Emoji is the fastest growing language in the UK
The emojis can convey that a child is experiencing physical abuse, that their parents drink, that they feel alone, or even that they have been experiencing dark thoughts.
The app was created following the news that 19,100 cases of assault against children and youth in Sweden were reported last year.
It is hoped these emojis will help children who might struggle to find the right words express themselves.

Creative internet users have designed a series of anti-logos in protest against the allegedabuse of workers in Qatar.
FIFA was heavily criticised for deciding that the2022 World Cupwill be held in Qatar, a countrythat has a red-hot climate and lacks the infrastructure to host such a large event.
But far worse criticism was to follow.
More than 900 workers have died in theconstruction projects for the competition, and some have estimated this figure to be rise to at least 4,000 by the time the buildings are finished.
Furthermore, the country has faced allegations of condemning migrant workers to slavery through the Kafalasystem, which lets workers in-country sponsors  usually their employers  confiscate their passports upon entry to the country and then make it difficult for them to leave.
Creative detractors have taken to sharing anti-logos of major of sponsors of the World Cup in a bid to encourage them to withdraw their backing.

The risk of accidental incest has never been greater after a surge in the number of kids born from sperm and egg donation.
A Cambridge professor believes previous research into families has not taken into account half-siblings in sexual relationships.
Susan Golombok, who has spent years studying the modern family, said a large amount of donor-conceptions happen in the same area.
She told the Hay Festival that many donor-conception children end up going to the same schools or living in the same town.

The Telegraph quoted her assaying: That is a big worry, that children might enter into sexual relationships with their half siblings and not be aware of it.
And various calculations have been made about how likely or unlikely it is, and most of these say its not really likely to happen.
But they dont take into account that these children often live in a community and are the same age and may even go to the same schools and so on.
I dont know what the actual chances are, but its probably higher than people think.

If you ever needed undeniable proof that cats believe themselves to be the dominant species on the planet  this is it.
Obviously this cat is far too important to make way for the peasant humans leaving this building, so he is forcing them to step over and around him.
However on closer inspection we realised this was not simply an act of outrageous laziness.
If you watch the video you will see how the cat would probably be happier if he moved two feet into the light so he could sunbathe.

Gingerol can stop cancer cells from growing (Picture: Getty Images)
Ginger helps fight ovarian cancer, a new study has found.
The research, by BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine , revealed the food tricks cancer cells into killing themselves.
The natural dietary component gingerol has been shown to shrink tumors by 56 per cent.
It works by blocking the cancer cells from growing and  ultimately  spreading.
The paper concludes: Ginger inhibits growth and modulates secretion of angiogenic factors in ovarian cancer cells.
The use of dietary agents such as ginger may have potential in the treatment and prevention of ovarian cancer.
It gives credence to previous studies that ginger extract has the ability to fight cancer.
In 2012 a study published bythe British Journal of Nutrition suggested the food had a natural positive impact on fighting prostate cancer cells in men.

The last supper: Jeffrey (R white shirt) is pictured with his loved ones just hours before he killed himself (Picture: WARREN SMITH 2015)
Assisted suicide is illegal in the UK.
So every year, a number of Brits living with terminal or particularly distressing health issues make the decision to end their life in the Swiss clinic Dignitas.
Butanyone caught helping themabroad could face up to 14 years in prison here.
Earlier this month54-year-old Jeffrey Spector killed himself after he was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour wrapped around his spine.
He faced being paralysed from the neck down at any moment.
Jeffrey and his wife Elaine (Picture: WARREN SMITH)
The successful businessman died surrounded by his wife and children who fully supported his decision.
His death is likely to reignite debate other whether or not assisted suicide should be legal in Britain.
Assisted Dying Bill
A move to allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose for the terminally ill was put before parliament last year.
However, it ran out before officials had the change to debate it.
But Lord Falconer has vowed to re-introduce the bill in the new parliament.
Mr Spectors case was a particularly interesting one because  unlike most Dignitas goers  he was not terminal. He said he feared being a quadriplegic more than death.
Critics believe legalisation could pave the way for countless people to unnecessarily end their lives when treatment is the better option.
Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, said: The vast majority of people with cancer or quadriplegia  which was a risk but not a present reality for this man  do not wish to kill themselves but want support and care to go on living as comfortably as possible.
Dignitas in Switzerland, near Zurich (Picture: Getty)
Any change in the law to allow assisted suicide in Britain will inevitably place pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives so as not to be a financial or emotional burden.
Meanwhile supporters say the decision to be yours and yours alone.
Mickey Charouneau, a spokesman for Dignity in Dying, said:It cannot be right that we force people to suffer against their wishes, or take drastic and desperate measures behind closed doors.
The only way to give dying people choice and control at the end of life, while also protecting vulnerable people, is through an assisted dying law with upfront safeguards.

Its an offer Mr President surely cant refuse.
A Kenyan lawyer has allegedly put 70 sheep, 50 cows and 30 goats on the table to marry Obamas daughter.
Felix Kiprono isnt leaving anything to chance, and has declared his love for Malia as real.
Speaking to The Nairobian , he said: I got interested in her in 2008 [Editors note: When she was 10]. As a matter of fact, I havent dated anyone since and promise to be faithful to her.

I have shared this with my family and they are willing to help me raise the bride price.
People might say I am after the familys money, which is not the case. My love is real.
I am currently drafting a letter to Obama asking him to please have Malia accompany him for this trip. I hope the embassy will pass the letter to him. I will hand it over to the US Ambassador with whom we have interacted several times.
The White House has yet to comment.

Dramatic footage has emerged showing the moment a pilot was forced to make an emergency landing during a flyover for the70th anniversary of VE Day.
The pilot was flying over the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, US, when he thought a fire had broken out in the cockpit.
It was in fact leaking hydraulic fluid which turned into vapour, giving the appearance of smoke.
He made the decision to abort the celebratory flyover and land on a nearby runway.
The edge-of-your-seat cockpit video was uploaded to YouTube by the pilot.
The pilot said the incident was a poignant reminder of lives lost (Picture: YouTube)
He wrote: The biggest lesson was how the leak presented itself in a vapor form. It moved and acted like smoke, combined with fluid heat on the legs of my passenger, it was mistaken for fire.
This event, especially on this day, gave a somber reminder to all those who didnt have a runway conveniently aligned.
To those who were hundreds of miles away from the nearest carrier, in enemy waters. To those who made the ultimate sacrifice. We remember.

A US policeman who pulled over a German driver for allegedly speeding warned him his ass would be hurting for a month if he were to go to jail.
The motorist was stopped by highway patrol in Nevada.
The officers asks for his paperwork before calling him Germany boy and saying he will get violated.
Do you know what the speed limit is here Germany boy  why are you driving in my country? asks the cop in an aggressive tone.
The driver said he was following the car in front when he is accused of breaking the speed limit.
The cop continues: You were leading the pack. This aint the Autobahn.
You know what happens to nice little boys who go to jail for reckless driving? Ass will be hurting for a month.
I suggest you slow down and do 70  or you will be violated.

        <MainBody>Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 26 May 2015 7:43 am
We associate a large growl in our stomachs as a war cry for food  but it actually means your gut is cleaning itself.
Tummy rumbling comes at a time when we feel hungry, but it isnt a biological mechanism to remind us to eat.
Around an hour after we finish digesting our system undergoes a muscular contraction to sweep any remaining food from the stomach into our intestines, saysGuilia Enders, author of Germanys hit book Gut: The Inside Story Of Our Bodys Most Underrated Organ.
In her punchy guide to our body, the 25-year-old explains the gut cleaning takes place some time in between meals. Nutritional scientists recommend we leave a five hour gap from one meal to another.
Snacking will stop the cleaning process immediately (Picture: Getty)
Snacking at any time will stop the process.
Guilia also makes the interesting point that our stomach starts just below our left nipple and ends at the bottom of the ribcage  generally much higher than we think.
So when people complain of a stomach ache the pain is more than likely happening in our intestine.
The poo chart
Types 3 or 4 are considered healthy. Experiencing any other type on a regular basis is good grounds to consult your GP.
Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass).
Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy.
Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface.
Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft.
Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges, passed easily.
Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool.
Type 7: Entirely liquid.

Science tells us its okay to go out on a school night and get a bit sloshed  but only if we get seven hours sleep.
Booze isnt to blame for low productivity at work, experts believe.
Instead, theyve linked it to a lack of sleep.
Researchers from Cambridge University and Rand Europe found that smoking and eating as much as we like wont have a negative impact on productivity either.
They monitored 21,000 UK workers who slept for either six hours or less a night and seven to eight hours.
The study found that those who had slept for longer were notably better performers in the office.
Not exercising is also a negative factor.
Employees with concerns of a financial nature were found to be less productive as well.
As well as poor work performance a lack of sleep has been linked to a number of health issues including diabetes.

Some women may have a genetic impulse to be unfaithful (Picture: Getty Images)
Its a common defence of men caught cheating that theyre wired to do so.
But if thisresearch is anything to go by, some women may also have a genetic impulse to be unfaithful.
In astudy published in Evolution and Human Behaviour , 7,400 sets of twins in Finland who were in long-term relationships and aged between 18 and 49 were looked at by researchers, who found nearly 10 percent of the male participants and 6.4 percent of the female participants had had at least one affair in the past year.
The researchers were interestedin the rate of cheating between non-identical twins (who dont share all their genes) and identical twins (who do) and found that 63 percent of the variation of infidelity in men and 40 percent in women could be down to genetics.

The male and female drives to cheat could be very different (Picture: Getty Images)
Isolating specific genes is more difficult because thousands of genes influence any behaviour and the effect of any individual gene is tiny, said Brendan Zietsch, a lead researcher at the University of Queensland, Australia.
But we did find tentative evidence for a specific gene influencing infidelity in women.
The so-called cheating gene is the vasopressin receptor gene, which is responsible for empathy and sexual bonding in animals. In men, this gene had no influence on promiscuity.

Researchers conceded that the evidence is tentative (Picture: Getty Images)
In the New York Times , psychiatrist Richard A. Friedmanargues that the female drive to cheat may be down to simple pleasure-seeking.
While there is an evolutionary advantage to men cheating, he says, there is no obvious reason for women to be unfaithful, other than the search for novelty and sensation seeking.
There may be no clear evolutionary advantage to female infidelity, but sex has never just been about procreation, he said.
Cheating can be intensely pleasurable because, among other things, it involves novelty and a degree of sensation seeking, behaviours that activate the brains reward circuit which conveys not just a sense of pleasure but tells your brain this is an important experience worth remembering and repeating.

Tom Hoel regained his title (Picture: YouTube/Tom Hoel)
The former record holder for the longest plank has regained his title after losing it last October.
Two minutes of the plank, a bodyweight exercise that requires you to support your body on your elbows and toes and hold your body straight (just like a plank!), is normally enough for the average person to start losing their form, though people in good shape may be ableto hold the position for up to five minutes.
Try not to feel too demoralised, therefore, to hear that Danish fitness instructor Tom Hoel, 51, just held a plank for four hours and 28 minutes, setting a new world record and regaining his title after he lost it last October.
Mr Hoel beat his previous best time by around 80 minutes in Jaegerpris, Denmark, on Friday, but admitted he had a serious crisis for almost two hours.
Chinese SWAT officer Mao Weidong held the previous record (Picture: AP Photo)
I have never pushed myself that far, he told the Local.
I had a serious crisis for almost two hours.After mentally arguing with myself, I finally asked for the time at three hours and 41 minutes.
I thought that I was still under three hours and was ready to quit but when I realised I that had beat my former record and the goal was within sight, I mobilised every resource in my mind and body.
Mr Hoel said that he spent nine months preparing for the attempt, eating healthily, getting a lot of sleep and giving upalcohol.

This video appears to show the shocking moment that a police officer pepper-sprayed a man while he was suffering from a stroke.
In the video, officer Shaun Jurgens can be seen walking up to David Washington, after he drove the wrong way on a street in Fredricksburg, Virginia.
But he then proceeds to seemingly fire a Taser at Washington without warning while he is still sitting at the wheel of the car.
And after another police officer opens the car door, Jurgens sprays a huge amount of pepper spray into Washingtons face.
Get out the car, Jurgens shouts.
Get out the car, or Im going to f*****g smoke you. Get out the car, right now. We aint playing.
(Picture: Fredericksburgh Police Department)
At one point in the video, Washington can even be heard telling officers that he cant breathe.
He was later taken to the hospital, where it was discovered that Washington was suffering from a stroke.

Jurgens has since resigned from his job after police determined that the level of force used was not appropriate.
But he has defended his actions, claiming that he believed Washington may have been under the influence of drink and drugs.
Separate charges have been filed against Washington for hit and run, reckless driving, and driving on a revoked license.

A teenage girl who was abducted by a gang was murdered even though her parents paidthe 84,000ransom demand.
Isarve Cano Vargas, 19, was abducted shortly after meeting Angel de Jesus Carrasco Lopez, 21, and his friends in Tehuacan, Mexico, police believe.
Authorities say Lopez and friends Efrain Mendez Cabrera, 28, and Jairo Adan Gutierrez Cabrera, 21, then rang the teens family and demanded 2million pesos (84,000) for her release, which the family paid.
They then reportedly demanded a further 140,000 pesos, which is when the Vargas family contacted police. The teenagerwas found dead soon after.

Police believe that the gang murdered Ms Vargas before they demanded the first ransom payment.
We suspect that they were worried she could identify them, and decided not to take any risks, said a police spokesman.
The body was found 20 miles from the city of Coxcatlan. Local reports suggest she was strangled, although a post-mortem examination could not confirm this.
Lopez and his friends have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and rare being held.

The tables are turned: A lion is chased up a tree by the very animals it was hunting (Picture: Barcroft)
The king of the jungle doesnt always win.
This is the extraordinary moment the tables were turned in Kenya when a lion was chased away by the herd of buffalo it was stalking.
The series of incredible images, taken by ex-army officialCharles Comyn, show the hairy beast fleeing before scrambling up a tree.
(Picture: Barcroft)
Mr Comyn, who was exploring the reserve with his wife, said: All of a sudden, literally out of nowhere, a male lion sprang out from his hiding place hightailing for a nearby tree with the buffalo now starting to give chase.
It didnt take long before the lion had scrambled up the tree, fearing for its life.
The marauding buffalo circled below, smelling the lion. They were not going to let it get away.
(Picture: Barcroft)
The terrified lion slid down the tree after a few second and made for a nearby bush.
It was a hair-tingling moment, he continued. The lion could not hang for long  one could really sense that he was almost doomed  so he had to make another attempt to flee.
(Picture: Barcroft)
Very quickly the buffalo resumed their early morning grazing. It was only then that we spotted the newly born calf in the middle of the herd, which they obviously had been protecting from the lion who possibly had spotted a potential light breakfast.
What a magical, unforgettable and, as we later learnt, unheard of occurrence.

Its always pretty satisfying when a hateful protest takes a turn for the worse, and those involved are left to look extremely stupid.
And thats exactly what happened when the Westboro Baptist Church attempted to protest against Ireland voting yes to gay marriage.
Having now probably realised that their Gods hate fags shtick is a bit old, they decided to spice up their displays of vitriol by waving an Irish flag.
They posted a Vine titled You flip a flag upside down to show a nation is in distress. Like when they pass fag marriage by popular vote.
Or if you turn the Irishflag around you dont look like an Irishman in distress, you look like someonewith a passion for Ivory Coast.

But if were being honest, it just looked like a bloke who wasnt sure about which way to hang the tricolour flag.

This picture caused confusion as viewers saw it differently (Picture: Swiked/Tumblr)
Remember that nonsense about the colour of the dress which sent the internet into meltdown?
Well, it turns out that we were all wrong  after a new book suggested that theres no such thing as colour, and its actually just an illusion.
In the book Outside Colour, Dr Mazviita Chirimuuta suggests that colour has always just been a concept in our heads, but forms when light is transformed by our minds.
Of all the properties that objects appear to have, colour hovers uneasily between the subjective world of sensation and the objective world of fact, he wrote.
And its believed that illusions such as The Dress are proof of how colour is perceived differently, with the colour of an object often leaving a temporary imprint on our eye.

Dr Chirimuuta added: If we step back a moment, we can appreciate how very weird it is to expect there to be a connection between the manifest visual world, brought to us by our senses, and the rarefied scientific image of a world made up of physical particles.
And further evidence suggested that we didnt even realise colour existed until it was described  with ancient languages failing to have a word for blue.

It has four legs, but no apparent head.

This should already be a given but if you work for the government and was thinking of wearing Ugg boots and a onesie to work, youre no longer allowed to.
Thats in Australia anyway, where the casual clothing items were officially banned for public servants employed by the Immigration Department.
New guidelines, which go into effect today, also forbid thongs and jeans, which are probably less outrageous depending on how you wear them.

There are certain things that wouldnt constitute professional business dress and that would be things like jeans, thongs, Ugg boots and so on, Jan Dorrington, from the Immigration Department, told the Senate Estimates Committee.
The departments secretary Mike Pezzullo was in full agreement despite not finding about the onesie until recently.
I didnt even know what a onesie was and I was shown pictures of such garb, he told ABC .

If youve seen the latest Avengers movie, youll be well aware that the prospect of a robot created from artificial intelligence is pretty terrifying.
But its one that Google could be on the verge of creating, according to SpaceX boss Elon Musk.
Writing in his new book Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, journalist Ashlee Vance recalled a conservation he had with Musk over dinner.
He opened up about the major fear keeping him up at night: namely that Googles cofounder and CEO Larry Page might well have been building a fleet of artificial intelligence-enhanced robots capable of destroying mankind, Vance wrote.
Im really worried about this, Musk said.
And despite Musk being close friends with Page, he spoke of being worried that Page could produce something evil by accident.
Speaking to Business Insider, Vance added that Musk believed Pages experiments with AI to be nave.

Its not the first time that Musk has warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence, having previously likened it to summoning the demon.
And hes been backed by both Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking, who both similarly warned that a cautious approach should be taken towards AI technologies.

You know the ones (Picture: Alamy)
That really annoying Facebook friend of yours who brags online actually has very low self-esteem.
A new study, which confirms what weve all been thinking, found that people who post statuses about accomplishments are typicallynarcissists.
Psychologists at Brunel University London surveyed Facebook users to examine the personality traits and motives that influence the topics they choose to write about in their status updates.
The data was collected from 555 peoplewho completed online surveys measuring the big five personality traits  extroversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness  as well as self-esteem and narcissism.
The research found
People with low self-esteem more frequently posted status updates about their current romantic partner.
Narcissists more frequently updated about their achievements, which was motivated by their need for attention and validation from the Facebook community. These updates also received a greater number of likes and comments, indicating that narcissists boasting may be reinforced by the attention they crave.
Narcissists also wrote more status updates about their diet and exercise routine, suggesting that they use Facebook to broadcast the effort they put into their physical appearance.
Conscientiousness was associated with writing more updates about ones children.
Psychology lecturer Dr Tara Marshall, from Brunel University London, said: It might come as little surprise that Facebook status updates reflect peoples personality traits.
However, it is important to understand why people write about certain topics on Facebook because their updates may be differentially rewarded with likes and comments. People who receive more likes and comments tend to experience the benefits of social inclusion, whereas those who receive none feel ostracised.
Although our results suggest that narcissists bragging pays off because they receive more likes and comments to their status updates, it could be that their Facebook friends politely offer support while secretly disliking such egotistical displays.
She added: Greater awareness of how ones status updates might be perceived by friends could help people to avoid topics that annoy more than they entertain.

Apparently some phone calls are so important that you stay on the line even when youre being shot at.
CCTV footage of a pavement in Cincinnati, Ohio, shows a man walking along the street with his mobile phone pressed to his ear when a drive-by shooter sends a hail of bullets his way.
The man ducks away before pulling out his own gun and returning fire. All while continuing with his phone call.
Its not until he runs off that he finally takes the phone from his ear.
Police believe the shooting was part of a turf war between two rival gangs.
WLWT reports that the only injury reported was a cut knee caused by shattered glass.

The owner of a barber shop has been accused of racism after charging customers more for a haircut if they are white.
The owner of the shop in Northern Italy attracted complaints to police after he opted to charge different prices depending on a persons skin colour  meaning white people pay more than black people.
When police broke into the Gloria Coiffeur Beauty Centre in the Veneto region of Northern Italy, they seized a price list  which seemed to support the accusations.
The owner, who is African, is now being quizzed by police.
On the list, the barber appears to charge 10 Euros (7) for a white haircut, as opposed to 6 Euros (4) for a black haircut.

I took one look at the price list and voted with my feet and walked out. Its a disgrace.

Greek hospitals have run out of basic supplies such as painkillers and sheets after budget cuts left the health service desperately short of funds.
Crippling austerity has left millions of Greeks unemployed, while 2.5million peopleare now uninsured, a massive increase from the 500,000 in 2008.
Healthcare spending has fallen by more than a quarter since 2009, leaving hospitals lacking even the most basic supplies, including scissors, sheets and painkillers.

Its not its usual prey, but that didnt stop one alligator taking on a truck.
In a video posted to YouTube by keet246, an alligator can be seen lying in the grass with its jaws open as a truck inches towards it.
But the truck pushes the gator too far and it suddenly leaps up, grabs the bumper in its jaws and rips it off, also dislodging the wheel guard in the process.
Not its usual prey (Picture: YouTube)
The ease with which the alligator does this is incredible, but we shouldnt be surprised.
Gators have a bite strength of 2125 pounds per square inch  enough to bite through steel.
The alligator bite pales in comparison to that of its crocodile cousin, however. The saltwater crocodile can slam its jaws shut with a force of 3,700 PSI.

For humans afflicted by blindness, a guide dog can prove to be an invaluable source of support.
But it turns out that theyre pretty good at doing the same job for their own species too, after the younger siblings of a blind dog became her guide.
Kiaya, a 10-year-old Akita, lost both eyes after she was diagnosed with glaucoma.
But now, siblings Keller, 2, and Cass, 8, have become her guide to stop her from bumping into things.
Speaking to WXYZ, owner Jessica Van Husen, from Michigan, explained: I think she would be lost without them.
Kiaya is looked after by Keller and Cass (Picture: Facebook)
She relies on them. When they are coming in from the back yard they rub up against her. They guide her.
And the vet who originally removed Kiayas eyes described the situation as remarkable.
Its clear the other dogs are trying to protect her. Their sense of loyalty is really remarkable, Dr Gwen Silasaid.

Describing their incredible routine, Jessica added: Cass always allowsKiayato get to her food dish first and waits for her to start eating.
When I take them in the car, he leans against her to keep her steady because she sometimes gets a little off kilter. He also loves to groom her.
Cass definitely took the role upon himself to guide her around the yard which made me of course cry my eyes out.

A booze-fuelled night took a turn for the worse when a man allegedly slashed a friend in the neck with a machete that he was swinging around his head while dancing.
According to reports, the pair had been arguing shortly before 5am in Woonona, New South Wales, Australia.
And when police arrived, they found a 28-year-old man bleeding after being slashed in the neck.
He was taken to Woollongong hospital with non-life threatening injuries, but will require surgery.

A courageous wheelchair bound musician has been killed in a car accident while raising money for charity.
Frank Barhams trip, in which he hoped to push himself 302 miles, ended in tragedy on Wednesday on a highway in Georgia.
The 59-year-old was only 30 miles from the finishing line in Savannah when a tractor hit a van that was tracking the jazz harmonica player, which then slammed into him in Screven County.

The best way you can remember him is when you feel low and down, like I do sometimes he told me we have to be positive, his wife Adriana Barham told Channel 2.
Margaret Kargbo, who was part of his entourage and travelling in the van, was also killed.
The charity trip from Atlanta to Savannah started on May 11 and was due to end on May 25 and was raising money for Wheel 2 Live.
The musician was paralysed at the age of 24 when he was involved in another car crash.

A paralysed man finally got to fulfil his wish of holding abeer but he had to use some mind control tomake it happen.
A video showed Erik Sorto, from Los Angeles, completing his ultimate goal of drinking a tipple despite him being made a quadriplegic in 2002 after getting shot.
How was it done?
Surgeons at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California placed a pair of small electrode arrays into Sortos posterior parietal cortex, or PPC.

These neural prosthetics were then connected to computers that processed Sortos brain signals and determined his intent, allowing him to control a robotic arm mounted to a table nearby, or a computer cursor.
Sorto said he had a few tasks lined up other than drinking.
On the top of the list is that I want to be able to groom myself. I want to be able to brush my teeth by myself, he said.

Neural prosthetic devices have previously been implanted in paralysed patients motor cortex, the part of the brain that directly controls body movement.
However, while those patients could control a robotic limb, movement was delayed and jerky.

An image of a woman straddling a dolphin on a beach has re-emerged online and people are still angry about it.
Theyre so unhappy an online protest has been started, with the imagecaptioned: Keep reposting until we can ID these idiots who killed this poor dolphin.
Call the police if you know who these people are.
They are animal killers!! Lets ID them and send them to prison. Keep reposting.

But the picture, which was posted with other images showing the animal being roughly handled, may not actually tell the full story.
The dolphin may have actually been dead at the time, according to posts on reddit , where the series of four images were first uploaded in March 2014.
For a dolphin to just let someone pick it up like that is strange, a user wrote, according to Huffpost .
They are very strong so Im assuming it was nearly dead or already dead when the pictures were taken.
The pictures were apparently taken in Lima, Peru.

Jennifer Smiths son received this note
A mother decided to fight back against sexism when her son was invited to a school pool party which forced girls to follow strict clothing regulations.
Jennifer Smith, from Indianapolis, US, was outraged when her son brought home a permission slip for the party, which stated: All girls must wear a non-white t-shirt over their swimsuit.
Speaking to the Huffington Post, Jennifer said she was enraged by the rule.
Being a feminist and seeing things through that filter, I was just kind of enraged by that, she said.
Theyre saying little girls need to be ashamed of their bodies and cover themselves up.
The pool party was a school treat to pupils for good behaviour
And while she doesnt have a daughter, Smith admitted that she wanted to set the right example for her son.
I have a little boy, Im teaching him to think correctly, and this is contrary to what Im teaching him, she admitted.
Defending the regulation, the Principal of Rhoades Elementary said that the dress code was enforced after girls previously wore inappropriate swimwear.
Due to the varying sizes of students at this age, [making T-shirts mandatory] takes away the ability of kiddos making fun of others for wearing a shirt [since] everyone is required to wear one, she wrote.

Ireland is on course to make history by becoming the first country in the world to introduce gay marriage by popular vote.
With counting of ballots only beginning at 9am, early patterns from count centres suggested that the campaign to extend the right to marry to same-sex couples will succeed.
A high voter turnout was recorded in all regions, particularly in urban areas, with a huge youth vote and returning emigrants heavily influencing the ballot.
A worldwide #hometovote campaign saw hundreds of Irish nationals travel back to their home country to cast their votes.

In Dublin the result was expected to be a landslide in favour of gay marriage while in many other parts of the country the constitutional amendment was expected to be passed by about two to one.
John Murray, director of the Iona Institute religious think-tank, one of the leading groups fighting the reform, accepted the result was going in favour of the reform.
Obviously Id be disappointed in that. We did our best to fight a good campaign and if having run that we havent won it, we did our best, he said.
Everyone is saying it is Yes and Im not going to argue with that.

An official result is expected some time in the afternoon but if tallies from the 27 count centres in 43 constituencies continue the same pattern seen in the first hour, campaigners will be calling it much earlier.

Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin told RTE Radio that he was confident the result would see the introduction of gay marriage.
I think it was a debate that captured the imagination and I had a strong sense that the Yes vote would win,he said. I think that will be borne out today.
Results from the constituencies will be fed back to the count headquarters in Dublin Castle, where about 2,000 people are expected to gather in the upper courtyard to mark the day.

It is only 22 years since Ireland decriminalised homosexuality.
Voters were asked one simple, specific question on whether to amend Article 41 of the 1937 Constitution by adding a new clause to a section titled The Family.
It asked them to support or reject a change to the 78-year-old document which reads: Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.
It does not suggest any change to the definition of the family or remove any outdated references in the section, including those that state a womans place is at home.
If passed, it would be the 34th amendment to the constitution but, regardless of the result, the campaign will rank with other hotly-contested issues such as divorce and abortion.
Other countries have held referendums on gay marriage, including Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia, where the extension of the right was not passed by the electorate.
In a separate referendum also being held today, voters are being asked their views on proposals to reduce the age limit on who can stand for the presidency from 35 to 21.

A woman has been found pushing her dead three-year-old son on a park swing.
The 24-year-old mother, who hasnt been identified, was reportedly seen pushing her dead son on the swing at Wills Memorial Park in La Plata, Maryland, on Friday morning.
Its believed that she may have been at the park all night, and the child didnt have any visible signs of trauma, police said.
In a press release, police explained that they arrived at the park after hearing reports of a woman pushing a young child in a swing for an unusually long time.

But when they arrived at the park shortly before 7am, they realised that the boy was dead and his mother was pushing him back and forth on the swing.
She has now been taken to hospital, while an autopsy is set to determine the cause of her sons death.
Diane Richardson, a spokeswoman with the Sheriffs Office, said: Its a very sad and tragic situation for the mother, her family, the officers.
Were working very hard on that.

This video shows the brilliant moment that one cab driver proved how ridiculous homophobia is, by pretending to be a heterophobe.
In the prank, which was filmed ahead of Irelands gay marriage referendum, a cab driver can be seen driving through the streets of Dublin, and repeatedly tells passengers about his unusual opposition to heterosexual couples.
Saddam Hussein and Hitler, whose kids were they?, he controversially remarks to support his argument.
(Picture: Facebook)
And at one point, he even admits I wouldnt even let them in the car, and that would be the end of it.
At the end of the clip, a sign simply reads all discrimination is ridiculous, hammering home the pranks important message.
The clever prank was the brainchild of cab app Hailo, who were providing voters with free trips to their polling station for yesterdays referendum.

The world-famous landmark was closed today (Picture:Getty Images)
The Eiffel Tower closed to the public for most of the day as workers protested over a rise in aggressive pickpockets around the Paris landmark.
The walkout came a day after city authorities announced that crime against tourists in the French capital had dropped this year thanks to reinforced police presence and video surveillance.
The tower did not open this morning because staff were concerned about petty crime around the site.
Clusters of tourists streamed beneath the tower, unable to reach its viewing platforms.
It remained closed while staff and management held meetings about security measures, then re-opened in the late afternoon, according to the company that manages the site.
 Marius (@MMNewzz) May 22, 2015
Tower employee Denis Vavassori of the CGT union said the workers want a permanent police presence.
He said: It is a growing problem. There were always pickpockets at the Eiffel Tower but now we are really facing an organised group.
Paris authorities said yesterday that violent theft was down 25 per cent and pickpocketing was down 23 per cent in the first four months of 2015, compared with the same period last year.

Almost mesmerising, if it wasnt so darn painful!
What is cramp?
Cramp is yourmuscles suddenly contracting
The shortening and tightening of muscles is what causes the pain
Cramp can last from a few seconds to ten minutes
Throughout that period you cannot control the affected muscle
They can occur for no apparent reason but have been linked to liver disease, exercise or certain medication

He wrote: To the individual who stole my bike previously here: If you have a shred of decency you will return it with a new lock and re-evaluate your life choices.
This was secured to the post where hed left his bike.
Then a note slapped underneath reads: Hey Bozo, its illegal to lock your bike to a handicap pole.
Check with the city for your bike. They probably removed it so it would not block a wheelchair accessible van.

A hospital has launched an investigation after medical students put a drink in a dead mans hand and partied with the corpse.
Nine students have been suspended following the bizarre celebration atHospital de Clinicas in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo.
An intern is believed to have spotted the cadaver in an A&amp;E corridor and moved it.
The body was found in a nearby toilet by the mans relatives  who raised the alarm.
Health director Jorge Quian said: When theres a mistake in medicine, theres never a single person responsible.
I think these youngsters committed a bad error but there are other people at blame here, the superiors who were supposed to be in charge of them and hospital bosses.

The former Italian prime minister hasnt posted anything too outrageous yet, despite having uploaded a massive 60 pictures in the last 24 hours.
The 79-year-old has treated his fans to images of his dog, his dinner and, of course, pictures of his girlfriend Francesca Pasquale, 29.

Mum buys two bears for birth of son 30 years ago, hes now giving one to his new-borndaughter
View post on imgur.com
Theres a reason one of these bears is extremely dishevelled and the other is in pristine condition and it might be the most heart-warming thing youll read all day.
Posting the image on Reddit, the original poster wrote: When my brother was born in 1985, my mother purchased two identical teddy bears.
The one on the left has been my brothers for 30 years, the one on the right has been kept in storage for my brothers first child who was born today.
FREAKING ADORABLE, RIGHT?
Hopefully my new niece, Claire, will love him just as much, he added.
And as for why the bear looks somewhat battered, he explained: According to my mother its been on many vacations, gotten soaked in pool-water time and time again, and got lost on a theme park ride at Disney World.
It has certainly seen a lot.

The horror(Picture: Lemelson-MIT)
Do you fear getting an injection? How about swallowing this pill lined with tiny needles instead.
The Microneedle Pill (mPill) could replace injections in the future by releasing medicine directly into the blood stream.
Tiny needles are buried in a coating that dissolves once it reaches the gut.
The digestive tract of the body squeezes drugs out such as insulin.
The oral capsule allows the drugs to act much faster than they currently do, according to inventor CarlSchoellhammer.
His team atMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has now been awarded a 9,600 fund to develop the groundbreaking device.
It looks pretty big here (Picture:Lemelson-MIT)
How the mPill works
The capsule is 0.8 inches (2cm) long and 0.4 inches (1cm) wide
The microneedles are 0.2 inches (0.5cm) long and made of stainless steel
Coating hides the needles which is dissolved when it hits the gut
Drug is then squeezed out by digestive tract
Capsule is excreted with no side-effects
MrSchoellhammer says because there are no pain receptors in our gut the internal injection would not cause any pain.
The capsules were trialed on pigs and it took more than a week to pass through the cut.
However, researchers found no sign of tissue damage.

Its coming to the end of a long, tiresome week  so kick back and reward yourself with this amazing webcam of some walruses chilling out in Alaska.
Ok, so its pretty dark in Round Island at the moment, and youll just be faced with darkness and a cacophony of walrus grunts if you happen to be watching the cameras live stream.
Juuuuust chilllllling (Picture: Explore.org via AP)
But rewind to the start of the stream, and youll encounter the glorious sight of a group of walruses just chilling out on the beach.
Its weirdly hypnotic, and their relaxed state is the kind of Zen that youll be wanting to achieve after a tough week at work.

Duke was a bit larger and scruffier than before but after this tearful embrace, there was no doubting he was the Rottweiler that dog trainer Joshua Edwards had lost eightyears ago.
Mr Edwards had been crushed when Duke vanished from his home in Shenandoah, Miami, in 2007.
After searching for the puppy for six months he gave up and came to terms with the fact hed never see the dog again. It turns out,he was wrong.
The two are together againafter Duke was found on a Miami street and then identified through a microchip, according to CBS Miami .
Duke and Joshua Edwards (Picture: YouTube/Miami Herald)
We are going to have a good time. He is going home. He is going to be pampered, said Mr Edwards after being reunited with his pet in an emotional video filmed at Tamiami Animal Hospital.
Mr Edwards became a dog trainer due to the impact of his loss, but despite this positive hed much rather have had nine-year-old Duke at home all these years.
I am glad to have my dog home. He is a part of my family, he added.
It is hard because not everybody understands but the people that do know exactly what I am talking about.

        <MainBody>Due to the huge volume of the now missing ice, it has had a small impact on the planets gravitational field.
Even more terrifyingly the mass melting shows no signs of stopping any time soon.
Dr Wouters who worked on the study said: The fact that so many glaciers in such a large region suddenly started to lose ice came as a surprise to us.
It shows a very fast response of the ice sheet: in just a few years the dynamic regime completely shifted.
The team believe climate change which has led to changes in wind direction has in turn meant the temperature of severaloceans has increased, causing the ice shelves to melt at such a rate.

Gretchen Carlson was accused by some viewers of suggesting the Muslim God was not the same as her Christian one, which for some reason offends a lot people.

The terrorist group could be ruling a larger area of the country than Syrian president Assad, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

ISs seizureof the town of Palmyra yesterday came after it captured the strategic city of Ramadi in Iraqs largest Sunni province.
It has raised concerns the extremists may destroy some of the priceless ruins in the countryas they have done in neighbouring Iraq.
In Damascus, Maamoun Abdul-Karim, the head of the Antiquities and Museum Department, said Palmyras town museum had suffered minor damages during the IS onslaught.
The city is now totally controlled by gunmen and its destiny is dark and dim,he warned.

Charles Abbott informed the court the owls name was Solomon (Picture: Aspen Police)
We think its fair to assume one man wasnt taking his trial very seriously when he announced that his stuffed owl would be acting as his lawyer.
Aspen, Colorado, man Charles Abbott was in court accused of violating a protection order involving his former roommate, Michael Stranahan. Abbott was alleged to have entered Mr Stranahans room while he was out of town and retrieved some belongings.
Taking his seat in court on Tuesday, Abbott sat a fuzzy horned owl on the defence table with him, telling the court its name was Solomon and it would be representing him in court, the Aspen Times reports.

Incredibly, Pitkin County Court Judge Erin Fernandez-Ely ignored the owl, instead asking the victim if he would be willing to amend the protection order to allow mediation.
He wasnt.
The hearing ended with the protection order remaining as it was. Abbott was told he may attend the same church as Mr Stranahan as long as he doesnt have contact with him.

If youre planning to get lashed in Germany this summer mimes will make you feel guilty.
Authorities in Berlin are hiring the silent actors to tell tales of how drinking too much can have serious consequences.
The strange tactic is in response to a growing number of anti-social problems including noise and littering  largely down to tourists.
Mimes will be rolled out over 15 weekends in the district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.
Lutz Leichsenring, from a group representing the citys bar and club owners, said: We dont want to give people orders.
We want to use street theatre to sensitise tourists to the problems of noise and littering and to make them aware that people are living and trying to sleep nearby.

Home brewing enthusiasts could soon be making morphinealongside their alcohol.
Making beer in your basement is one thing but being able to manufacture a drug there also may give the authorities sleepless nights.
But thats a distinct possibility in the future after scientists engineered brewers yeast to synthesize opioids such as codeine and morphine from a common sugar, for the very first time.
As heroin belongs to the opiate group of drugs it would be possible to make this also, according to the report published in Nature Chemical Biology .

It is going to be possible to home-brew opiates in the near future, Christopher Voight of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the research, told reporters.
Some experts have called for the new tech to be regulated before things get out of control.
But if you havent got nefarious motives in mind then the new method could prove usefulfor those suffering from severe pain.
Brewed morphine used for pain relief would be easier to acquirethan the regular version, which is grown in opium poppy farms.

The substance had preserved the skeletons.
It can be very moving handling these remains when we apply the plaster, conservator Stefania Giudice told journalist Natashas Sheldon.
The expert from Naples national archaeological Museum added: Even though it happened 2,000 years ago, it could be a boy, a mother or a family. Its human archaeology, not just archaeology.

Islamic State fighters in Syria have stormedthe historiccity ofPalmyra leaving its ancient ruins under threat of destruction.
The blood-thirsty terror organisationseized control of the central citys military air base, prison and intelligence headquarters, having stormed it on Wednesday, said Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Clashes since this weekhave killed at least 100 pro-government fighters,withforces withdrawing, according to Syrian state media.
Abdulrahman, who bases his information on a network of sources on the ground, said there were so far no reports of destruction of the citys historic artefacts.

The capture of Palmyra was a major triumph for the militant group, days after it took the strategic city of Ramadi in Iraqs largest Sunni province.
As IS took Palmyra, government forces collapsed in the face of the attacks and Syrian soldiers were seen fleeing the area, activists said. In Damascus, state TV acknowledged that pro-government forces had withdrawn from the town.
The ruins at Palmyra are one of the worlds most renowned historic sites. Before the war, thousands of tourists a year visited the remote desert outpost, a cherished landmark referred to by Syrians as the Bride of the Desert.

Many Palmyra residents are fleeing the town towards the city of Homs and Damascus, according to Talal Barazi.
Mr Barazi, governor of the central province of Homs which includes Palmyra, said the Syrian army is outside the town, from where it is targeting IS reinforcements.
We have not received any news about [the archaeological sites] destruction, he said. We hope that there will be no massacres in the city or damage to the ruins.

American fast food workers have been showing the world the appalling conditions they are forced to live in due to their low wages.
The exhibition, which is called I, Too, am America, is part of the Fight for $15 movement, in which food workers are asking for higher pay in order to afford basic necessities.
Mona Lee, 20, is part of the exhibition in Kansas City which is affiliated with local labour organisation Stand up KC.
She works two jobs, sometimes back to back, and only brings home $7.25 (4.66) per hour.
Speaking to Slate she said: I dont understand how I can work at two jobs and not have enough money to put food in the house.We need to be able to live.
Here are some of the sobering images from the exhibition.

However the campaign is far more thanan art project.

Warning: Strong language
This is the moment a man who claims he was sexually abused as a youngster confronts his alleged attacker.
The video shows someone walking towards a man as he waters his garden in broad daylight.
He then accuses him of performing oral sex on him at the age of 13.
He asks: Would you be willing to apologise to me for sexually abusing me years ago?
The accuser is toldto get lost and he threatens to call the police.
Then the man denies the allegations, saying: I did not sexually abuse you.

The alleged victim points to a nearby house and accuses the man of performing oral sex on him in a room when he was 13-years-old.
How can you say that? he replies. You sexually abused me right there, in that room. You performed oral sex on me. Will you apologise to me for it?
But the man then says: I dont know why I should apologise for what was a consensual situation.
He goes on to claim that the man was 18-year-old at the time, not 13, and he has witnesses to prove it.
The video ends when the man becomes increasingly more impatient and repeatedly asks the person to get off his property.

Offices should play the sounds of flowing mountain streams to improve workers productivity, a study has recommended.
An experiment at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute looked at alternatives to the white noiseplayed in some officers to reduce distractions and make speech unintelligible beyond a certain distance.
And the team found that when it came to increasing productivity, the sound of water flowing through mountain streams was the most effective aid.
The mountain stream sound possessed enough randomness that it did not become a distraction, said Alana DeLoach, who assisted in the study.
This is a key attribute of a successful masking signal.
Professor Jonas Braasch, an acoustician and musicologist who led the study, added that it may have uses outside the working place.
You could use it to improve the moods of hospital patients who are stuck in their rooms.

Natural sounds have become increasingly popular as tools for increasing productivity and relaxation.

They say size doesnt matter, so why do us small people still feel like were missing out on so much in life?
*Weeps into XS T-shirt*
Well my vertically-challenged chums, the news gets worse Im afraid  tall guys earn more.
The findings, which led scientists to believe that every extra inch a man has in height is equivalent to 510 a year in salary, has beenwell documented.
But now a new paper has shed some light over the theory that suggests the sharpest jump in earnings takes place between those who are54 and 56.
Andreas Schick, an economist at the FDA, and Richard Steckel, an economist at the Ohio State University, believe taller people earn more because they are more self-confident and have higher emotional intelligence.
(Picture: Getty)
This may be a result of how they have beentreated by people throughout their lives.
These theoriescome from tracking a group of UK men born in 1958.
They discovered that the most important factor was how much nutrition they received as a child.
A youngsters diet can have a huge influence on intelligence and height.
However, other factors come into play when talking about someones earnings  in particular their outlook on life and cultural perceptions.

Man attacked by brutal bike gang in front of wife and daughter speaks out for firsttime
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 20 May 2015 12:18 pm
A driver who was brutally beaten by a bike gang in front of his wife and daughter wept in court as he told for the first time how he feared for his life.
The attack onAlexian Lien shocked the world when helmet-cam footage of the incident was uploaded online and viewed by millions.
Lien was testifying at the trial of undercover detective Wojciech Braszczokwho is charged with assault and other crimes following the New York City motorcycle rally that devolved into pandemonium.
Co-defendant Robert Sims has also been charged with similar offences.
Lientold a judge: Complete fear. For my life, for my wifes, for my daughters.
Lien said he, his wife and their toddler were heading to New Jersey for some shopping for the couples anniversary in September 2013.
But when they hit Manhattans West Side Highway in their blue Range Rover, they crossed paths with hundreds of bikers. Some were popping wheelies and slapping the tops of cars they passed.

One motorcyclist tried to block other cars from going north to allow the bikes to pass, but Lien said he was annoyed and wanted to get on with his day, so he kept driving. As the bikes whizzed by, his wife tossed a half-eaten plum and later a water bottle at the bikers, he said.
Tensions rose. A motorcyclist knocked off his rear-view mirror, and Lien was eventually forced to a stop as some bikers got off their rides and approached his car.
And as theyre around my car, I feel it being hit, being kicked, he said. Im horrified at this point, and I recall asking my wife what do I do? what do I do? She says Just go! Just go!.
And I make a hard right because I see theres an opening and I  I just go.
He ran over someone, the bikers gave chase and eventually caught up with the family where they smashed the car window and battered him senseless.

Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass accused Braszczok of failing to act as a police officer.
Braszczok reached into a broken window on the SUV, then stood by and eventually drove off as others pulled Lien from the car and attacked him, prosecutors said.

The new research reminds us of the movie the Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Picture: YouTube)
Scientists may have just gone and done the unthinkable by identifying an anti-ageing drug.
Early research in mice found that theAlk5 kinase inhibitor (sciencey talk for protein which impacts growth control)simultaneously sprung back old muscle and brain tissue into a youthful state.
David Schaffer, of the University of California, Berkeley Stem Cell Centre in US, said: We established that you can use a single small molecule to rescue essential function in not only aged brain tissue but aged muscle.
That is good news, because if every tissue had a different molecular mechanism for ageing, we wouldnt be able to have a single intervention that rescues the function of multiple tissues.
As we age our bodies gradually shut down because adult stem cells stop replacing damaged ones.
This new drug targets those failing stem cells and restores their ability to do their job.
Experts have praised the find, but voiced caution that the research is still in its very early stages and other stem cell pathways are continually explored.

The turtle was facing a lifetime in captivity (Picture: BTech Innovation)
A turtle had to have a new beak printed it after it was hit by a boat propeller.
And now it looks awesome.
The loggerhead turtle was facing a lifetime in captivity following the boat accident.

But thanks to a Turkish biotechnology company specialising in 3D medical prosthetics, it was fitted with a new beakat the sea turtle Research, Rescue and Rehabilitation centre at Pamukkale University.
And like some kind of cyborg reptile from a sci-fi film, the loggerhead now has an ultra-strong titanium jaw with BTech emblazoned on the side.

The project took two months of research and development, usingCT scans and computer software to create a model of the turtles beak, which they called AKUT3.
Itwas then 3D-printed in medical-grade titanium, and fitted to the turtle in a two-and-a-half-hour operation.
There is still a small chance the prosthetic could be rejected by the turtle, but if that is not the case, it will return to the sea shortly, where it will look infinitelycooler than all the other turtles.

Talk about dedicating yourself to your craft.
A 42-year-old photographer has been living as an elderly woman for two years for her latest project.
Kyoko Hamada, who grew up in Japan before moving to the US aged 15, got the idea for a photo project after volunteering to visit lonely senior citizens in their homes.

Since 2012, she has been posing as the fictional Kikuchiyo-san and taking photographs of herself for her99-photo collection I Used to Be You.
No one seemed to care, or even notice me. Its already very easy to feel ignored in New York City, but as Kikuchiyo-san, I sometimes felt totally invisible, she told the Huffington Post .
I have always been drawn to elders. I often sense an otherworldly air from them as though they are still living in another time.

Hamada, who has had her work featured in thePDN Photo Annual, Communication Arts, PDN Under 30, American Photography Annuals and the NY Photo Festival, said that the name of the project came from what Kikuchiyo-san might tell her if they ever met.
Shes now trying to publish her photo collection and has started a Kickstarter campaign to try and raise the $10,000 she needs.

A man put his girlfriends puppies in a bag and then ran them over in his van because they were making a mess of the house, police said.
Jeremy Ellis, 41, was reportedly seen while his girlfriend was away opening the passenger-side door of his van and dropping a trash bag containing sevenfour-week-old Chihuahua puppies.
Witnesses said they heard the distraught crying of the dogs. Ellis was then reportedly seen running them over.
Somebody needs to run over him, said an angry neighbour of Elliss, who chose not to be identified.

He couldve easily loaded them up in that van and taken them to a shelter or something.
The neighbour added that he had started feeding the puppies because Ellis was deliberately neglecting them while his girlfriend was away.
Elliss girlfriend called police when she came home and found the puppies gone. She told officers Ellis had text messaged her saying he had got rid of the puppies because they were making a mess of the house.
Two of the puppies had to be put down following the incident.
Ellis is charged with seven felony counts of animal cruelty.

This video appears to show the emotional moment a blind man was able to see for the first time in 21 years.
In the clip, the father  known only as Daniel  can be seen anxiously waiting to open his eyes after successfully undergoing a cornea transplant.
And as his daughter encouragingly shouts youre doing great dad, he opens his eyes for the first time.
He appears visibly stunned as he manages to finally see and shouts wow as he takes in his surroundings for the first time in more thantwo decades.
But perhaps the most touching moment occurs when he is able to see his daughter for the first time in her lifeand lovingly describes her as more beautiful than I could ever have imagined.
It is not clear where the short clip was filmed, although the comments suggest it is at a private eye hospital in theUnited States.
Metro has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Were fairly sure this isnt how this type of scenario is supposed to go down.
When a fully-grown bear approached Swede Ralph Perrson, it was the outdoorsman that came out on top thanks to his crazy roar.
Mr Perrson, from Ljusdal, north of Stockholm, was training his pet beagle in the forest when the dogs bark changed  and he realised another animal was close.
But the experienced outdoorsman saved him, his wife and his dog from a certain mauling when he lifted his arms up and roared in the bears direction  and it ran away.
To lie down and play dead I do not believe in, the outdoorsman said (Picture: YouTube)
I suspected when the dog changed (there might be a) bear, said Mr Perrson.
You have to have respect for the animals.
I cried all I could and made (myself) very great. It was a metre away from me.
To lie down and play dead I do not believe in.
Were impressed.
But not as impressed as we were by this man , who responded to a bear appearing outside his house by punching it in the face.

To some people, youmayseem like this after one too many drinks (hilarious, life and soul of the party).
And to others, youll just seem a bit like this.
But theres a reason for that, and its because of the way that alcohol reacts to receptors in our brains.
Writing for The Conversation , Dr Ian Mitchell ofthe University of Birmingham explained the reason for those drunken acts of stupidity that we always regret in the days after.
Dr Mitchellexplained: Alcohol impairs the activity of the brain circuits that make us feel anxious and, at higher doses, alcohol inactivates a second set of brain circuits that control fear so threatening stimuli no longer seem quite so scary.
Alcohol also compromises our ability to compute risk so that situations we would normally shy away from may now seem quite inviting.
MORE: It looks like Queen Elizabeth': Dad regrets botched tattoo of his daughter on his arm
(Picture: PA)
And when it comes to getting a little bit rowdy after a few, it seems this happens because alcohol can corrupt our ability to understand the intentions of others.
The brain contains specific circuits, which connect parts of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and temporal parietal junction that handle our social cognitive abilities, he writes.
Alcohol also impedes our ability to accurately interpret emotional expressions in the face.
As we drink, we have a tendency to erroneously assume that some facial expressions of negative emotions are happy, and we find it particularly difficult to identify sad and angry faces. This leaves us prone to making embarrassing social errors.
Dr Martinalso stressed that while the effect of alcohol will wear off the next day, the long-terms effects of it certainly wont.
Chronic heavy drinking can lead to brain damage and irreversible cognitive impairments, especially poor memory function, and psychiatric problems including depression, psychoses, anxiety and suicide, he added.

We understand politicians do a lot of silly things but imitating a Native American by making a whooping cry is still quite shocking.
US Senate candidate Loretta Sanchez apologised yesterdayafter a videotape surfaced showing her making the offensive gesture while speaking at a convention on Saturday.
You can hear groans from the crowdwhen she taps her hand over her mouth and makes the whooping sound at around 40 seconds in the YouTube clip.
Rep. Loretta Sanchez has apologised (Picture: AP)
She appeared to be making a joke about the difference between Indian-Americans and Native American Indians.
In defending herself against criticism, Sanchez fell back to the tried and tested method of claiming she had Native American blood in her family.
In this crazy and exciting rush of meetings yesterday, I said something offensive, and for that I sincerely apologise, she told delegates.
Not everyone was having the apology though, especially her Democratic rival in the Senate race, Attorney General Kamala Harris,whose mother was an immigrant from India.
She called the gesture shocking.
The two Democrats are the leading candidates for the seat being vacated by retiring Senator Barbara Boxer.

Follow this advice and youll be OK (Picture: Airbnb)
Before you consider using Airbnb you might want to check out these tips.
Most people who utilise the home rental service will have a good experience, but for some it wont be so great .
Takethis advice and you might ensure youre notone of the unlucky fewwho have a nightmare.
Tips for host
1. Make it clear who can rent your house
You can find out more about a guest once they go through the Verified ID process, which will help you decide if they are right for you.
But before this, try and figure out who will work for you and put it in the advert.
Remember though, you cant discriminate against someone just because you dont agree with their sexuality .
Jonathan Wang said he and his partner were asked to leave (Pic: ABC-13)
2. Keep all communication on the Airbnb website.
This is to ensure you dont have to reveal any personal details and there is a record of everything.
3. Dont be a bad host by cancelling at the last moment
Airbnb will penalise you financially for doing this, although it says it understands there can be some unforeseen circumstances.
4. Remember theres always a way to resolve any disputes through the resolution centre
This is on the website and should be utilised should you have a beef with a tenant or host.
Tips for guests
1. Look at host reviews
This is a no brainer really. If you want to know if the home youre staying at is any good look at the old reviews.
If there arent any yet then youre taking a gamble.
2. You might be paying but its not a hotel
This means you shouldnt expect all the comforts that come with a hotel.
You should also leave the accommodation in a clean state.
3. Dont have a drug-fuelled orgy in the house
4. When its time to go, make sure you leave
Dont be like tenants at a home in Santa Cruz, California, who had to be paid $1,000 (638) to leave .

Vladimir Putin is known for being a big tough guy  not scared of America and certainly not scared of some little ice hockey players.
However you dont want to p*** off a man who was once in the KGB.
The Russian president (who, we hasten to add, is 62-year-old and NOT a professional athlete), had no trouble holding his own against some of the best ice hockey players alive recently.
In fact, he managed to score and incredible eight goals while playing in Sochi  the other team only scored six altogether!

Now, were not saying anyone let him score to spare his feelings, but it was an exhibition match, so they might not have been taking it too seriously.

He might be on Twitter already, but President Obama has seemingly grown bored of his official account, and has now established a profilefor his own personal tweets.
Hes chosen to go with the appropriate handle of @POTUS (President of the United States), and posted this cheery message as his inaugural tweet.
Hello, Twitter! It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account.
 President Obama (@POTUS) May 18, 2015
Were fully expecting him to post some cracking selfies and show us that theres a pretty normal bloke behind all that President business.

Passengers on a bus in Atlanta made a dramatic escape just seconds before it was hit by a train.
At the beginningof the clip, the bus driver can be heard desperatelybeeping the horn after getting caught in traffic right in the path of an oncoming freight train.
Realising that the bus will not move in time to avoid the train, he instructs passengers to get off and they quickly make for the exit.
And the last passengers get off just seconds before the Chessie-Seaboard train slams into the side of the bus, sending it flying.
Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority officials said that six people were injured in the collision including the 38-year-old bus operator, who is now on paid administrative leave.
As the video shows, however, the situationcould have been much, much worse.

Renting out a home from Airbnb can be good and bad (Picture: Airbnb/Metro)
Renting out your home through Airbnb can be a great way of making some extra cash, but be warned, it doesnt always go to plan.
Sex orgies, squatters and drug taking are just a few of the problems owners have faced.
But dont cancel that rental just yet. Most people who use the servicehave pleasant experiences.
Weve put together a list of the good and bad things that can happen.
Good: Many people have earned extra money by renting out their home with Airbnb, which has allowed them to go on holidays, carry out home improvements and treat their families tosomething special.
Bad: You could get booted out of somewhere because youre gay like Jonathan Wang and his partner Brent.
The two men were denied entry into a room they had rented in Galveston, Texas, because the owner didnt approve of their lifestyle.
Airbnb were having none of it and immediately cancelled the contract, saying: We have a zero tolerance policy for discrimination on Airbnb.

Good: You can stay in this floating house thats currently making its way along the Thames and you wont have to pay rentas its the prize in a competition.
No you werent still dreaming  there is a house floating up and down the Thames (Picture: Mikael Buck/Airbnb)
Bad: Mark and Star King returned home to find a drug-fuelled orgy had taken place in their house after they had rented it out for the weekend.
An estimated $75,000 (48,500) of damage had been caused at the residence in Calgary, Canada. Luckily for them it was covered under Airbnbs insurance policy.

Good: You can watch Formula One through the window of this special Airbnb apartment .
The accommodation looks out onto the site ofthe Malaysian Grand Prix  the Sepang track.
If football is more your sport then why not try a room at theMaracan Stadiumin Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that has aperfect view of the pitch.
The views are heart-racing (Picture: Airbnb)

Bad: If you decide not to follow Airbnbs advice by only booking through them, you might have to pay your guests $1,000 (638) to leave like Poonam Sandhu did .
The 33-year-old from Santa Cruz, California, thoughtit was the only way to get rid of the squatters after they refused to leave.
She had made newarrangements with them when the original contract with Airbnb had ended.

This is the ancient site of Palmyra in Syria, and its currently being protected by a group of Monuments Men, who have have banded together to help protect the areas 2,000-year-old artefacts from the hands of barbaric Islamic State militants.
The group, who have been dubbed the Monuments Menafter the George Clooney film of the same name, are attempting to protect the ancient ruins amidfears that Isiswould destroy artefacts at the UNESCO world heritage site, after similar acts of destruction.

Speaking to the Sunday Times, Syrian archaeologist Amr al-Azm explained that the teams efforts were similar to the Monuments Men who saved European art from Nazis during the Second World War.

With the scale of the damage thats being done, were not winning.

It is believed that Isis militants view such sites as targets for destruction due to their desire to decimate all non-Islamic history, and the icons and carvings are viewed as idolatrous.
Their efforts are also being aided by Syrian archaeologist Isber Sabrine, who has urged the Syrian government to send reinforcements to protect Palmyra, and has contacted a group of volunteers who undertake first aid on buildings damaged by the Islamic State.
He said: If we lose Palmyra it will be one of the biggest cultural catastrophes in history.
We are really training trainers, then send them inside Syria to train others. Its a chain.
Its very risky and they are putting their lives in danger.
The ruins inside the ancient city of Palmyra date back to the 1st and 2nd century, with the citys temples and streets formed from a blend of Persian and Greco-Roman influenced architecture.
The groups attempts to save the town come after the destruction of ruins in the ancient sites of Nimrud and Hatra in Iraq.

Mamoun Adbulkarim, the Syrian governments antiquities chief, previously expressed fears that Palmyra would suffer a similar fate if it wasnt protected.
If IS enters Palmyra, it will spell its destruction It will be a repetition of the barbarism and savagery which we saw in Nimrud, Hatra and Mosul, he added.

Aruna Shanbaug (Picture: Handout)
The tragic story of a nurse who was raped so violently 42 years ago that she was left in a coma from which she never recovered ended with her death today.
In 1973 Anura Shanbaug was raped and strangled by a hospital worker in her native Mumbai, leaving her with severe brain damage.
She was diagnosed with pneumonia last week, leading doctors to make the decision to take her off her life support machine.
Author and friend Pinki Viranihad petitioned to have her euthanized, asking Indias Supreme Court to end Ms Shanbaugsunbearable agony.
The supreme court rejected her petition, which was opposed by the nurses atMumbais King Edward Memorial Hospital who had been caring for Ms Shanbaug for decades as her family were unable to do so.

Virani told the BBC: My broken, battered baby bird finally flew away. And she gave India a passive euthanasia law before doing so.
While her story may provoke further debate on euthanasia in India, it is the incident that left her in the vegetative state which is truly shocking.
While working late at night in a hospital in 1973 Ms Shanbaug was attacked by cleanerSohanlal Bhartha Walmiki as she was changing clothes.

He was since been released from prison.

A British woman was found deadin a swimming pool while on a romantic holidayof a lifetime with her partner.
Rachel Turner and Stefan Brown, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, had flown out to Thailand as part of a seven-week trip through south-east Asia.
But just one week into the holiday, Ms Turner reportedly went for an early morning swim in the pool at the Sofia Gardens Resort on Koh Chang and was found dead soon after by a member of staff.
We had got up at 7am [the previous] morning because of jet lag, we hired out a motorbike and just drove around the island, Mr Brown told MailOnline .

He took the sport to an extreme level with highlining  walking across a rope suspended between towering rock formations while wearing a parachute for safety in the event of a fall.
In 2009, he set a record for completing the longest base jump from the Eiger North Face in Switzerland by staying in flight in a wingsuit for 2 minutes and 50 seconds.

In the brutal footage, which was posted on LiveLeak, a group of children can be heard screaming as the teacher rushes over and starts to whip the boys with his belt.
And as nervous pupils rush out of the way, one can be seen peering at the camera with a terrified look on her face.

The Bandidos have chapters all over the world (Picture: Getty Images)
The Bandidos and the Cossacks were two of the five gangs involved in a shootout in Waco, Texas, that left nine people dead and 18 injured this weekend.
According to Heavy.com , the two motorcyclegangs have been feuding since 2013, when the president of the Alibene, Texas, chapter of the Bandidos was arrested on allegations of stabbing two Cossacks.
Heres what you need to know about the two gangs.
The gang was founded by a Vietnam War veteran (Picture: Getty Images)
1Theywere founded in Texas inthe 1960s
The original chapter of the Bandidos Motorcycle Club was opened in 1966 in San Leon by Vietnam War veteran Donald Chambers. Members wearpatches showing a man in a sombrero with a machete and pistol under the slogan We are the people our parents warned us about.
Three years later,the Cossacks were formed, adopting the motto We take care of our own and the colours gold and black. Less is known about by whom they were started or how, though it has been claimedthat the Cossacksbegan asan offshoot of the Bandidos.
One-percenter gangs operate outside the law (Picture: Getty Images)
2 The Bandidos are the larger gang but bothhave chapters abroad
The Bandidos is by far the larger of the two gangs, with more than 100 chapters in the United States alone, as well as European, Asian and South American branches.
They are a one-percenter gang, a description that stems from a possibly apocryphal comment made by the American Motorcyclist Association in which they said 99 percent of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens.
The One Percenter Encyclopediaalso lists the Cossacks as a one-percenter club, and says they have large chapters in Australia. They have a much smaller presence than the Bandidos, however, which may explain why they appeared to be aligned with a third biker gang, the Scimitars, during the shootout in Waco.
Clashes between the Bandidos and the Hells Angels resulted in 11 deaths in Scandinavia (Picture: Getty Images)
3 The Cossacks may be challenging the Bandidos dominance in Texas
Former undercover agent Steve Cook told Vox that Texas hasnt historically been a hotspot for motorcycle gang violence. He said, however,that this may be because of the near-universal control that theBandidos, one of the largest and most powerful gangs in America, had inthe state. But Mr Cook believes that the Cossacks may be challenging their dominance by looking to form alliances with othergangs like the Hells Angels, a rival of the Bandidos.
Five different gangs (not pictured) were involved in Sundays shooting (Picture: Getty Images)
4 The Bandidos and the Hells Angels wereinvolved in the Great Nordic Biker War
The Bandidos and the Hells Angels were locked in a three-year war across Scandinavia between 1994 to 1997.
Gangsters Inc. reports that there were gun fights, car bombs and even an anti-tank missile filed at a prison cell during the war, which ended with 11 people dead, 74 attempted murders and 96 people wounded.

5 The shootout in Waco, Texas, was one of the worst the city has seen
Police said there were almost 100 bikers at the scene from up tofive different gangs. The argument began over a parking issue and gangs opened fire despite knowing that police were present.
They knew we were here, they knew that weve been here at their past events. And it mattered not to them, said Sgt. Patrick Swanton of local police.
Sgt. Swanton added that they were operating on good intelligence to be at the scene.
We are extremely fortunate, this could have been much worse, he said.

It wont come as any real surprise if we happen to tell you that the scientific community isnt exclusively formed by men, funnily enough.
But a leading astronomer recently came under fire when he made the mistake of referring to scientists as boys with toys, and pretty much discounted the fact that science isnt one big boys club.
Speaking to NPR, Professor Shrinivas Kulkarni of the California Institute of Technology, said: We astronomers are supposed to say we wonder about the stars and we really want to think about it.
Many scientists, I think, secretly are what I call boys with toys. I really like playing around with telescopes. Its just not fashionable to admit it.
And then female scientists and engineers cottoned onto his comments, and spawned the hashtag #girlswithtoys, creatinga brilliantly empowered response.
Remember all that One small step for man malarkey? Wouldnt have been possible if it wasnt for Margaret Hamilton.

Balancing one one leg could be a simple way of testing your cognitive function (Picture: Getty Images)
How long can you stand on one leg?
The answer to that question may tell you how well your brain is functioning and how susceptible you are to suffering a stroke.
University of Tokyo scientists asked more than 1,300 men and women with an average age of 67 to stand on one leg with their eyes open.
Those who struggled to balance for 20 seconds or longer  which represented around a third of the study group  had the worst cognitive function test scores as well as the highest prevelance of cerebral small vessel disease and the most minute haemorrhages, which correspond to the likelihood of suffering a stroke.
One-leg standing time is a simple measure of postural instability and might be a consequence of the presence of brain abnormalities, said Yasuharu Tabara , who led the study.

Ever wanted to watch civil unrest unfold across the world in real time?
Us neither. But now you can anyway.
With the support of Google Ideas, the GDELT Project, which claims to be the largest open database of human society ever created, monitorsbroadcast, print and onlinenews in almost every country around the world and identifies patterns and themes.

It then displaysthese trendsas a series of visualisations. For instance, as civil unrest increases in parts of the world, the local news coverage in those places reflects that. This coverage is then displayed on the map.
Unrest is defined extremely broadly here, reads the GDELTProject site.
From hunger strikes, stone throwing, police brutality, checkpoints and border closings to violent clashes with police and security services, to outright armed conflict and rebellion.
The GDELT Project say, however, that discussion of a protest does not necessarily meanan actual protest is occurring at that location.

Warning: Strong language
Watching your child take his or her first steps is one of the greatest joys a parent can experience.
When that experience is completely unexpected ANDyou manage to catch it on film  well thats just amazing.
Proud dad Wesley Lawrence was trying to film his 9-month-old daughter crawling across the lawn recently.
Instead he got to document her first time standing on two feet.
The amazed Wesley can only utter holy s*** as she wobbled about on the grass.

Do virgins make better soldiers?The Indonesian army think so.
The countrys military leadershipbelieves that female candidates who have lost their virginity outside wedlock could bring bad habits into their ranks.
The test of their virginityis a finger in their vagina and one in the anus.
Fiancs of Indonesian military officers have also for decades been subjected to similar testing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected the basis of this procedure stating: There is no place for virginity testing; it has no scientific validity.

Indonesian Major General Fuad Basya said: If it is not restricted this way, then someone with a bad habit will become military personnel.
Soldiers are a nations defenders. They defend a nations sovereignty, a countrys territory and security.

General Basya stated that if a woman lost her virginity outside wedlock,it would make her unfit to be a soldier,according to the BBC.
He added: It may be because of an accident, disease or because of a habit  meaning sexual intercourse.
If it is their habit, the Indonesian military cannot accept potential recruits like these.

ChadMichael Morrisette, who works as a brand consultant and designer in Los Angeles, California, said he was surprised to find a Facebook message from a man (who he has not named) who had bullied him during his teens, Queerty reports.
When he opened the message, he found that it was an apology for years of bullying while the pair were at the same high school.
I was recently talking with my 10 year old daughter about bullies, the note began.
She asked me if I ever bullied anyone and sadly I had to say yes. What came to mind is how shitty and mean I was to you when we were in Jr. High.

Mr Morrisette told Queerty thatthe note moved him to tears and he was more than happy to accept the apology.
In a message he wrote back to the man, he said:
In 20 years you are the only person to apologize for being a bully to me when we were younger. I hope you can proudly tell your daughter that you have also apologized for it, and that we are good.
In a post to his Facebook page, Morrisette wrote that for teens who are being bullied, it does get better and better.

Ousted president Mohammed Morsi has been sentenced to death by an Egyptian court.
The verdict on charges relating to a 2011 prison break was announced in Cairo.
As is customary in passing capital punishment, Judge Shaaban el-Shami referred his death sentence on Morsi and more than 20 others to the nations top Muslim theologian, or mufti, for his non-binding opinion.
Morsi, Egypts first freely elected president, was ousted by the military in July 2013 following days of mass street protests by Egyptians demanding that he be removed because of his divisive policies.
He is already serving a 20-year sentence following his conviction on April 21 on charges linked to the killing of protesters outside a Cairo presidential palace in December 2012.

One is a former heavyweight champion of the world, and the other unsuccessfully ran to become President of the United States.
But Evander Holyfield and Mitt Romney put their different backgrounds aside last night as they stepped into the ring in Salt Lake City for one of the most unlikely boxing bouts ever fought.
Unsurprisingly, the pair werent contesting for a coveted title, but instead agreed to the charity bout in order to raise money for CharityVision, an organisation which helps to restore vision for people with curable blindness in developing countries.
Well, we say boxing match.
It was more a case of watching two grown men dance around in their shorts.

The Prime Minister of Luxembourg has become the first gay leader in the EU to enter into a same-sex marriage, after he tied the knot with his partner yesterday.
Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who became the leader of Luxembourg in 2013, married partner Gauthier Destenay, a Belgian architect  just months after gay weddings in the country were legalised.
Their union means that Mr. Bettel is only the second gay leader in the world, after Johanna Sigurdardottir married her partner in 2010, when she was the Prime Minister of Iceland.
Mr Bettel became Luxembourgs first openly gay prime minister when he formed a government in December 2013, and announced his intentions to marry Mr Destenay in June 2014.
Speaking to the media before the wedding, Mr Bettel explained that he had decided to be open about his sexuality in order to be honest in politics.

HAPPY WORLD WHISKY DAY! Like we all need another excuse to have a drink
To celebrate the occasion Metro.co.uk ventured into the heart of Kensington, London, to test the knowledge of hardened whisky connoisseurs and amateurs.
Could they tell the difference between a34.99 Laphroaig Select and 11.50 Sainsburys Basics whisky?
The results will surprise you.
Laphroaig
Website description: Laphroaig Select takes its name from the special selection of American and European casks, chosen for their unique character that they give during maturation.
Our Inspiration for our new Global expression has been take from history  70 to 80 years ago, the time of the last family member owner of the distillery, Ian Hunter.
Ian was one of the biggest influences in the history of Laphroaig indeed he was one of the first distillers to travel to bourbon county in the USA to identify new sources of casks that would give him greater consistency as well as new flavours. He later married this new style of Laphroaig with his traditionally matured (European cask) Laphroaig.
Nearly half chose Sainsburys (Picture:Getty)
Sainsbury's Basics whisky
Website description: Blended Scotch whisky
Nearly half of all those we put to the challenge pinned Sainsburys Basics as the more expensive tipple.
Interestingly, all of these participants described themselves as non-whisky drinkers.
But those who claimed to have a love for the stuff identified Laphroaig as the finer dramfrom a whiff.
A spokesperson for Sainsburys said: Whisky is one of the most complex and discussed spirits, enjoyed by amateurs and connoisseurs alike.
Laphroaig is a renowned whisky with a tremendous heritage, which makes it even more pleasing to know that our basics whiskey has stood up against it so well in a taste test.
Events are taking place across the UK to celebrate World Whisky Day  an occasion for any old Tom, Dick or Harry (or Jane for sexmisms sake) to get in the mix and broaden your alcoholic horizons. To find your nearest one visit the official website .

Dzkokhar Tsarnaev killed three people (Picture: Handout)
Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been sentenced to death by a Massachusetts court.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted last month on all 30 counts in the 15 April 2013 attack, which left three dead and 264 injured.
And some members of the jury wept as they returned the unanimous decision to sentence Tsarnaev to die by lethal injection.
After morethan 14 hours of deliberation, theseven women and five men of the jury found that he must face execution for the deaths of eight-year-old Martin Richard and 23-year-old Lingzi Lu.
Rebekah Gregory was one of Tsarnaevs victims, losing a leg in the bombing (Picture: Facebook)
Jurors decided against imposing the death penalty for the murder of policeman Sean Collier.
The defence argued it was Tsarnaevs older brother Tamerlan who shot the officer. They depicted the younger Tsarnaev as a good kid who was corrupted by his radical sibling.
Tamerlan, 26, died at the scene of the bombing after his brother accidentally ran him over.
But prosecutors said the bomber was a bitter terrorist who sought to punish America for its perceived crimes. They argued only a heartless terrorist would place a bomb behind children.
The death penalty is not allowed under state law in Massachusetts, but was permitted as Tsarnaev faced federal charges.

This city has taken a radically different approach to tackling homelessness and theyre close to ending itcompletely

The Medicine Hat approach is radically different to that of most cities (Picture: Getty Images)
A city in Canada has taken a radically different approach to tackling homelessness  and theyre very close to eradicating it completely.
Following a promise made in 2009, Medicine Hat in Alberta has been slowly lifting people off the streets by readily providing housing as and when the homeless need it  regardless of their situation.
In other words, whethera person suffers from alcoholism or substance abuse or has mental health issues is not important. There will always be housingfor them.
Contrast this with the prevailing attitude towards the homeless in most cities, which is that if they want housing, they need to get healthyfirst.
City mayor Ted Clugston knows this all too well  he used to believe it. In fact, he campaigned against the initiative when it was originally introduced.

Drug-related incidents have dropped, as has demand for emergency rooms (Picture: Getty Images)
It used to be, You want a home, get off the drugs or deal with your mental health issues, he told CBC radio.
But if youre addicted to drugs, its going to be pretty hard to get off themif youre sleeping under a park bench.
If you can get somebody off the street, it saves the emergency room visits, it saves the police, it saves the justice system  and so when you add up all those extra costs you can buy a lot of housing for that amount of money.
The initiative means no-one has to spend more than 10 days in an emergency shelter or on the streets before some kind of housing is provided.
Were pretty much able to meet that standard today, said Clugston.
Even quicker, actually, sometimes.
Fewer drug-related incidents have been reported to police since the policy came into being, while demand for emergency rooms has plummeted.

Leigh Erceg, 47, suffered a traumatic brain injury and now she is a gifted artist and poet. (Picture: Facebook)
A woman known for her love of Nascar racing and country life suffered a serious brain injury after a fall and then found she had atalent for modern art and poetry.
Leigh Erceg, 47, had previously lived a rough-and-readylife in remote Northwest Colorado before she fell into a ravine and her life changed into one of creative expression and mathematical pondering.
As part of her savant syndrome, she now sees sounds and hears coloursbut has lost all memory of her life before the accident. Tragically, shecould not even recognise her own mother.
MORE: The Albert Einstein font will help you write like a genius
Dr. Berit Brogaard, a neuroscientist at the University of Miami, told ABC News : Leigh is the only woman in the world who has acquired savant syndrome and synaesthesia following brain injury that I know of.
Most people, if you ask them to draw a house or a car, they will start with the outline of the car or house, and they will fill in the windows and door, and the wheels.
When you ask Leigh to draw something, she will start with the details. She is attending to details before she is attending to the whole.
Erceg, 47, and a selection of her artwork (Picture: Facebook)
Leigh spoke of her ordeal: I dont know what type of fall it was but it must have been pretty dramatic.
I just remember them saying Leigh, keep breathing. I remember it was a sheriff, and he said, Leigh keep breathing.
There isnt pictures, there is just words, Leigh keep breathing.
A sample of Ercegs poetry (Picture: Facebook)
Leigh now fills her home with artwork, mathematical equations and poetry and is getting to grips with her condition.
Since her 2009 accident, she can no longer feel emotion, something described as the flat effect but has learnt to chuckle and smile after certain social cues.
Her lifelong friend,Amber Anastasio said of Leigh: Leigh was a total extrovert. She was very confident.
I just know that she is different now.
Its not a bad different. Its just different. Its who she is now.

This isa potheads dream.
We can imagine a few weed smokers are probably wishing it was them whofound a 10-pound package of marijuana and not a local man in Alabama, United States, who simply handed the drugs in.
Ron Smith was taking a morning walk near the Cotton Bayou Beach access in Orange Beach on Tuesday when he noticed what he thought was a seat cushion floating in the water.
Upon closer inspection, he realised the package was actually a bag full of compressed marijuana.
Mr Smith then called police, who picked it up.
Authorities say the bag weighed 10 pounds and confirmed it was worth about $8,000 (5,077).
Another 12 pound package also washed up along a beach in North Carolina on May 10, with Atlantic Beach Police saying Tropical Storm Ana likely brought it ashore.

A father desperately called emergency services after boardingatrain to work  and realising hed left his baby daughter in the car at the station.
The man, who identifies himself in the call as Joe Murphy, parked at the North Quincy T stop in Quincy, Massachusetts, and boarded a train towards Cambridge.
It wasnt until he got off the train and walked towards work 45 minutes later that he realised his one-year-old was still in the car.
Frantically dialling 911, he turned around and got on a train back towards Quincy.

I left by accident my toddler in my SUV at North Quincy station my little baby, he told the operator.
Luckily, officers arriving on the scene found the girl safe in the back of the car, but Mr Murpy admitted it was very fortunate that it wasnt a hot day.
I know that we were also very fortunate as it was a mild temperature day and I had come to my senses before too long, he said.
Id like to thank the Quincy and Transit police departments as well as the responding EMTs for taking good care of my little one while I rushed back. She is safe and happy today.

Two drug-taking teenagers called emergency services after getting lost in a forest that is near impossible to get lost in in the middle of the day.
According to police, the Ontario, Canada, teens had taken something  although they refused to disclose what  and gone for a walk in a 50-acre forest in called Lackies Bush.
Even though the park is flanked by a busy main road and used as a shortcut by students at the nearby school, the pair still managed to get lost  and became so panicked that they called the police.

They were taken to hospital as a precaution.

A Lucian Freud painting of a naked job centre worker has set a new world record for the artists work by selling for more than 35 million.
The painting, entitled Benefits Supervisor Resting was sold for a whopping 35.8 million at Christies in New York yesterday, and shows 127-kilo Sue Tilley resting on a sofa.
Miss Tilley, who was nicknamed Fat Sue by Freud, began posing for him in the early nineties, earning 20 a day  and was painted by the artist four times.
She watched the auction live on her computer, but told the Evening Standard that she had never expected the painting to reach iconic status.
I was just like maybe Ill have one picture in the paper one day, but never in 100 years that they would become what theyve become.
Lucian Freud painted the iconic work in 1994 (Picture: AFP/Getty)
I did work out that even if I got 0.1 percent I would get $50,000, but I know that doesnt happen so whats the point? Money isnt everything, is it? Experiences in life are just as exciting really.
The 1994 painting was sold to London art dealer Pilar Ordovas, on behalf of an anonymous buyer, but its not the first of the four paintings to go on sale for a lucrative sum.
In 2008, another work entitled Benefits Supervisor Sleeping was sold to Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich for 17.25 million.
Brett Gorvy, international head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christies, said: Benefits Supervisor Resting is recognised internationally as Freuds masterpiece and proclaims him as one of the greatest painters of the human form in history alongside Rembrandt and Rubens.

Warning:The language is a bit rude
Reason cats are excellent#460,302:They can snatch bats out of the air.
A problem bat was dealt with in spectacular fashion by a cat with the resulting footage uploaded to YouTube.
User FreeNextGen said that he and his cat fought an epic battle with a bat that had come into his house, before adding that the cat did most of the work.
I primarily cowered in fear, he admits.
Great skills. (Picture: YouTube/FreeNextGen)
In the clip, he can be heard saying: You better catch that f***er.
And as if responding to the challenge, the cat, named Fedor (we hope named after MMA legend Fedor Emelianenko  a fitting namesake) leaps up intothe air, snatches the bat with its outstretched paws and pins it to the floor.
Fedors owner is then able to grab a cardboard box and pin the box in place.
What happened to the bat?
The beast lived! And was safely released back into the wild, FreeNextGen writes.

An opah is released with sensors to track temperatures as it dives off the California Coast (Picture: Reuters)
All fish are cold-blooded right? Nope  it appears there is a hot new fish in town which keeps its temperature upby flapping its fins.
The Opah fishs ability to regulate its own body temperature means it can swim faster and longer than its fellow predator fish chasing down speedy prey such as squid.
Weighingin at an impressive 14 stone (90kg), the oval-shaped fish reaches a mature size of an average car tyre.
After testing the gill tissue from an Opah caught off the California coast, biologists from theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) discovered this unique ability.

NOAA Fisheries biologist Nick Wegner holds an opah caught during a research survey off the California Coast (Picture: Reuters)
NOAA marine biologist Nicholas Wegner was reported by the Guardian saying: Before this discovery I was under the impression this was a slow-moving fish, like most other fish in cold environments.
But because it can warm its body, it turns out to be a very active predator that chases down agile prey like squid and can migrate long distances.
There has never been anything like this seen in a fishs gills before.
This is a cool innovation by these animals that gives them a competitive edge. The concept of counter-current heat exchange was invented in fish long before we thought of it.

A Fox News contributor is being accused of homophobia after she linked an engineers sexuality to the train crash he was recently involved in.
Brandon Bostian, 32, was the engineer on an Amtrack train which derailed in Philadelphia recently, killing at least seven people.
Many American news outlets have pointed out that Mr Bostian is openly gay and a gay rights activist.
Sandy Rios, who hosts Sandy Rios In The Morning on American Family Radio, said: I am not inferring to [sic] those of you who are gay rights activists and who like to monitor this show, Im not inferring that this accident happened because he was gay.
But I do think its an interesting part of the story.

I think its something to be discussed, and I think its a factor. she adds.

Theres a reason why this guy looks a little peeved about having a large purple handprint on his forehead.
Its because none other than Prince Harry is responsible for the unusual marking on the head of photographer Arthur Edwards, which seems a bit like a knighthood for the modern era.
The playful prank took place as the Prince visited a youth centre in Auckland, New Zealand, during an official visit to the country.
Gotcha!
The Prince was given the chance to decorate a mural at the centre with his handprint, and proceeded to plonk it on the head of the photographer after doing so.
But he seemed to take the prank in good spirits, and was seen laughing at the imprint straight after.
And HRH Hazzaalso showed off his skills with a cue as he took part in a game of pool.

Pretty Woman never got paid this much.
A rich businessman has reportedly offered a porn star 5million to be exclusive to him for the next 15 years, in a move that would have made Richard Geres eyes water in the hit 90s movie.
We could only remember Edward (Gere)offering Vivian (Julia Roberts) a shopping spree and a couple of thousand dollars (and, of course, his love) but one incognitoChinese millionaire has gone a step further.
The porn star in question is 22-year-old Rola Misaki  also known asTakizawa Rola  who is half Russian and half Japanese.

The pair have recently attended events together in the Chinese capital Beijing, with the manwearing a mask to hide his identity according to reports in the China Record and the Tokyo Reporter .

Nooo! She cant leave us like this, said GuangY, one of her 4.8million followers on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.
Mai86 added: Shes one of the best, a natural. I cant believe shes gone off with this man.
Misaki made her debut in the adult video industry in 2012 with the Prestige Label. And although not finding many fans in Japan she has become a hit in China.

The new Bugatti is expected to be releasednext year at some point, possibly during the Paris Auto Show.
Despite the Veyrons incredible speeds, it already faces competition as the worlds fastest car from theHennessey Venom GT, which claims to have beaten the Veyrons top speed by 0.63mph  however this hasnt been officially verified.

A fast food worker was filmed going above and beyond the call of duty recently by feeding a disabled womanher meal.
Ridge Quarles, who works at theQdoba Mexican restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, was caught performing this amazing act of kindness while on the job a few weeks ago.
The footage was put online by customer David Jones where it quicklywent viral.
Mr Charles, who no longer works at the restaurant, said the woman he was helping isa regular customer.
He told local Wave 3 radio station: Sadly enough she has to sit outside the restaurant until someone notices her or another customer thats coming in has to let her into the building.

I had helped her through (the) line and sat her out in the lobby, got her a drink, got her utensils and napkin and kind of started to walk off and I was like, you know.
Is there anything else I can help you with? and she turned around and she was like, Sir, if you dont mind could you help me eat?

It turns out sea levels could be rising faster than previously thought, which means some places are in serious danger of disappearing in the future.
Scientists had previously thought ithad slowed down over the last 20 years but new research from the University of Tasmania suggests they were wrong.
Geodesist Christopher Watson and his colleagues were able to show this after looking at older data, with their conclusions released in Nature Climate Change.
MORE: Is Nigel Farage about to re-resign?
Sea level rise is getting faster. We know its been getting faster over the last two decades than its been over the 20th century and its getting faster again, Mr Watson said.
This means places such as the Maldives may not be here for that much longer, with the holiday destination the worlds lowest lying nation.
Its just 1.5 metres from sea level on average and the UN has warned its occupants may have to leaveby 2100.
Tuvalu, a Polynesian island, is also in danger, as well as Bangladesh, with experts predicting half of the country would be flooded should there be a sea level rise of just one metre.
Scientists sayrising sea levels are being caused by global warming.

Leader Kim Jong Un runs a tight ship. Possibly too tight (Picture: Getty)
Thought you had it tough here, eh?
Well count yourself lucky you can at least have a drink with your mates, watch Netflixwhen youre feeling lazy and blast some Bieber in your bedroom  because all of these are illegal in North Korea.
Here are ten every day things thatll get you in trouble in the state-run country.
1. Drinking alcohol
(Picture: Getty)
In 2013 a North Korean military officer wasexecuted for disrespecting late Kim Jong-il by drinking alcohol during the 100-day mourning period.
2. Watching TV
Last year North Korea reportedly publicly executed 80 people for watching South Korean television shows.
Authorities forced some 10,000 people, including children, to watch the execution.
3. Driving

Onlystateofficials are allowed to own a car.
It is estimated that only one in every 100 people in North Korea own a car.
4. Playing music

5. Keeping in touch with people abroad

Making a call to someone outside North Korea will get you killed.
In 2007 a man was gunned down inside a stadium for making numerous international calls.
Six people were also crushed to death in stampede after the execution.
6. Having an opinion
None of that. Anyone caught criticising the regime is sent to an educational camp.
7. Leaving the country
(Picture: Getty)
Dont even think about a cheeky holiday to South Korea. Youll be hunted down.
8. Believing inreligion
(Picture: Getty)
North Korea claims to offer religious freedom but a Christian woman accused of distributing the Bible was publicly executed for the crime.
9. Watching porn
Viewing or selling pornography is punishable by death
10. Going online

Not what they were expecting (Picture: Twitter)
When you book yourself a five-star holiday, you probably imagine the worst case scenario is that your room is dirty, the staff are rude and the food is uncooked.
Some British tourists who flew out to Halkidiki, Greece, didnt find that the room was dirty. Nor did they find that the staff were rude. And they didnt find the food was uncooked either.
They couldnt. Because the hotel wasnt there. In fact, it was still being built.

In place of the luxurious Blue Lagoon Princess hotel were support posts and half-built walls, diggers, and piles of earth.
According to 19-year-old Jess Woodhouse, who spent 1,600 taking her mother Julie away for her 50th birthday, the hotel was advertised as a platinum lifestyle five-star hotel.
When we arrived we could see it was a building site, Jess told MailOnline .

We were told the room we were booked into wasnt ready and as everyone waited, we started walking around and saw just how bad it was.
The rep said it was the first time he had been there and he didnt know what to do. We waited about six hours before we were taken to another hotel. Some people ended up in two-star hotels.

As soon as we were made aware of the situation, our resort team worked closely with the hotel to arrange suitable alternative accommodation for affected customers.
We also offered a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience in line with our terms and conditions, which were accepted by customers at the time of booking.
We would like to reassure customers that whilst it is rare to delay the opening of a hotel, we continually monitor all the hotels in our programme to ensure they meet our high standards and guests currently on holiday at the Blue Lagoon Princess are enjoying their stay.

Warning: Strong language
This is absolutely heart-breaking.
A boy has been forced to pummel his first love with a sledgehammer, and it was his father who made him do it.
We doubt hell ever forgive his dad for forcing him to destroy one ofhis Xbox consolesand then threaten a second one.

In the YouTube clip, the youngster can be heard saying Its not my fault I didnt get them, in reference to him not getting good marks in school.
But his dad is having none of it and shouts lets go.
The boy then reluctantly strikes a white object (first Xbox) on the floor as he fights through tears and makes excuses.
When he arrives at the second black Xbox he throws the sledge hammer to the floor and refuses to destroy it.
At first his dad is angry but then seemingly forgives him as the clip ends without the boy having to smash the console.
I think hes learned his lesson though. Always do your best in school.

Half of the Netherlands works part-time and theyre one of the happiest countries in theworld

The Dutch are a pretty positive bunch (Picture: Getty Images)
No matter whichmetrics you use, the Netherlandsconsistently ranks as one of the happiest countries in the world.
Theyre open-minded, theyre laid-back and theyre generally a positive bunch.
They also have the highest number of part-time workers of any wealthy country. The Economist reports that26.8 percent of Dutch men and 76.6 percent of Dutch women of working age spend less than 36 hours a week working.
Compare that to the UK, where just over 10 percent of men and around 40 percent of women work part-time.

Dutch women seem perfectly happy playing a smaller role in the labour market (Picture: Getty Images)
There are a number of factors explaining this Dutch phenomenon. Women coming late to the labour market is one reason, and the dominance of Christian values in Dutch politics made it a cultural normfor those women to work part-time so they could still fulfill traditional family roles.
That may sound backward to some, but, as Slatereports , Dutch women could be considered extremely progressive when compared with most other women in the world.
Political participation and reproductive rights are extremely high. Thehuge pay gap is understoodas a consequence of the numberof women working part-timerather thangenderdiscrimination.
In 2000, a law was passed mandating that women have the right to cut back hours at their jobs without repercussions from employers, Slatereports.
Dutch women fought for the right to cut back hours at work without repercussions (Picture: Getty Images)
So would Dutch women prefer to play a bigger role in the labour market? Apparently not.
We look at the world of management  and it is a mans world  and we think, oh I could do that if I wanted, Maaike van Lunberg, an editor at De Stentor newspaper, told Slate.
But Id rather enjoy my life.
We cant argue with that.

B&amp;B owner now owns half the shares in an oil firm after her son accidentallyinvested
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 13 May 2015 9:38 pm
Someones attempt at investment just backfired in a big way.
The buddingentrepreneur accidentally bought nearly half of the shares in a Belize oil exploration company  in his mothers name.
Judith Williams, who ownsWyche Keep Country House B&amp;B in Malvern Hills, is now faced with the prospect of making a mandatory bid for the rest ofNew World Oil and Gas.
Her son, Christopher, purchased more than342 million shares in the Jersey-based energy company through a broker last month.
He thought he was taking only ten per cent of the firm but actually took 48.7 per cent.

A spokesman for New World Oil and Gas said: There has been confusion regarding the share register which will become clearer once the funding exercises are concluded and actual percentage holdings of individuals are ascertained. This will determine whether or not the company will be bid for.
In the meantime management and its advisers are focused on securing capital to deliver value for its investors.
Unfortunately for Mrs Williams, the Takeover Panel watchdog said that if she receives the shares then she will then have an obligation to extend an offer to the shareholders of New World Oil Group.

Facebook is rolling out a new setting which will let someone else take over your account when you die.
The new Legacy Contact lets users choose a friend or family member to manage the page instead of it floating in social media limbo.
The person who takes control of your account wont have access to private messages or other sensitive information.
But they will have the power to change your profile picture, accept friend requests and take down the page if they want.
Facebook product manager Vanessa Callison-Burch said: Its incredibly hard to lose someone, especially so suddenly.
Im sensitive to that and my heart goes out to everyone involved.
We wanted to be able to answer by giving people a choice.
And then we also wanted to better support families who were grieving, because we would hear things like, from a mum whose daughter passed away and they wanted to be able to add a couple of cousins who werent yet connected to the daughters account.

It could be you (Picture: YouTube)
Awesome news thatll make you re-think your life strategy: Taking a gap year is good for you.
Taking time out to find yourself reduces stress levels (and increases the number of rad stories you have totell), research has shown.
The impact of gong away on young peoples motivation to study was analysed for the first time in the Academy of Finlands research programme The Future of Learning, Knowledge and Skills.
It showed those who begin their further education directly after sixth form are more resilient in their studies and more committed to their goals. They also believe in themselves more.
However, on the other hand they find studying and aiming for their ambitious more stressful than the students who take a gap year, according to the findings published in Developmental Psychology.
Professor Katariina Salmela-Aro said: For young people the transition from upper secondary school to further studies is a demanding phase in life and many adolescents are tired at the end of upper secondary school.
The demanding university admission tests take place close to the matriculation examination in Finland and require diligent studying from students.
For many a gap year offers an opportunity to take a break and think about future choices while developing a positive view of the future.

Rumbled: The man was using profits from a booze-run business (Picture: Getty)
And he wouldve gotten away with it too, if it wasnt for the meddling retirement home staff.
A man in his 70s was caught hiding a prostitute under his bed, say officials in Philadelphia, US.
The unnamed man is accused of using profits from peddling alcohol to pay for hookers on the side.
He made booze-runs for less-mobile residents of a retirement home and sold them on at a profit.
But the man was rumbled when his place was searched and a lady-of-the-night was found, said county chief financial Officer Uri Z. Monson.
He was ordered to leave the home.

Grant Carruthers (Picture: Facebook)
Future girlfriends of this guy, be warned.
Grant Carruthershad such a meltdown after breaking up with his ex that he racked up a 4,000 bill on her parents Amazon account.
The 20-year-old from Cumbria also threatened to hurt her dog and smashed a window at her family home, a court heard.
Judge Paul Batty QC told him his Amazon Prime stunt was mean and sneaky.
He was handed a restraining order, 200 hours of unpaid work and a 12-month community order.
The man avoided jail (Picture: Facebook)
The judge said: I am not going to deprive you of your liberty.
It seems that this was a singular episode in your life when, as an immature young man, you couldnt come to terms with a relationship that had ended.

Momentary happiness is all about expectation (Picture: Giphy)
What causesinstant happiness? A sudden windfall? A promotion?
Perhaps  but not necessarily.
New research suggests that science may have found a formula for momentary subjective happiness, and it all depends onexpectations.
It looks like this:
Dont feel bad if that gave you a headache. In essence, what it says is that happinessis dependent on three things:
making safe choices that guarantee certain positive outcomes, or certain events, represented by CR;
your expectations for the outcomes of riskier choices, or expected value, represented by EV; and
the difference between the outcome you experience and the one you expected, or the reward prediction error, represented by RPE.
For example, if you arrange to meet a friend, your happiness should increase in anticipation of that meeting. If you manage to get a last-minute reservation at a restaurant, your happiness might increase even more.
If the meal is good, but not quite as good as expected, your happiness should actually decrease, says Robb Rutledge , of theMax Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research.
So then, apparently there is something to setting your targets low.

This way if you are gay.
Thats the message being broadcast in Morse code from a neon dancing gay sailor sign currently sitting in the Baltic Sea.
The sign, which was created by the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, was placed there in late April to deter Russian submarines, which have been spotted with increasing regularity in Swedish waters over the last few years.

The dancing gay sailor, which reads Welcome to Sweden  gay since 1944 is supposed to serve as a cost-effective Russian repellent. A week-long search for a submarine in 2014 cost Sweden 1.7 million.
If military action and weapons had worked as conflict resolution methods, there would have been peace in the world long ago, said Anna Ek, Chariman of SPAS.
If there is a submarine down there beneath the Baltic waves and the crew should happen to see or hear the Singing Sailor they are welcome to join us in the Stockholm Pride Parade on the 1st of August.
Russia has been roundly criticised for its anti-gayattitudes and gay propaganda laws.

The photo was uploaded in January but has caused a social media storm (Picture: laperlirrojah_delbarriooh)
This Instagram picture of a baby smoking a cigarette has not gone down well, surprisingly.
It emerged from the account of lapelirrojah_delbarriooh who lives in Valencia.
The 18-year-old posted the image with the caption: Already smoking at a year old, love you little one, youre my f****** life.
It was uploaded earlier this year but has now amassed more than 36,000 comments with many raising concerns about the childs welfare.
Antonio Nieto, president of the Spanish Association of Pediatricians, told The Local: I think the police would definitely consider it to be child abuse, it is just absolutely unbelievable.
Tobacco is intrinsically even worse than heroin and to give it to a baby whose lungs are still developing is even worse.
Even children who are exposed to passive smoking are more likely to develop lung conditions such as asthma or chronic bronchitis.

It is not fully understood why Demodex mites live on our face (Picture:Getty Images)
Hundreds of these mites are living on your face right now.
The microscopic organisms have eight-legs and their closest relatives are spiders.
They were first spotted in earwaxin 1842, but today a huge question mark still hangs over their existence and what they want from our beautiful grills.
Scientists say you could be home tohundreds  even thousands  of the creatures, with an estimated two per every eyelash.
They come out at night to mate. And when they reproduce, they dont hold back. Heres a video of one laying an egg. Their offspring tends to be large in size.
D. folliculorum are found in our pores while D brevis tends to live deeper in our oily glands (Picture: co/spl)
Research has also found that the mites do not poo because they do not have an anus. Instead, they store their waste until the day they die then release a load of bacteria.
Its not clear what they eat. But they have been known to devour each other.
An average of two mites live on every eyelash (Picture: Getty)
Megan Thoemmes of North Carolina State University in Raleighsaid: Some people think they eat the bacteria that are associated with the skin.
Some think they eat the dead skin cells. Some think theyre eating the oil from the sebaceous gland.
Our face mites
There are two species of mite which choose to live on your face:Demodex folliculorum and D. brevis.
They both have short legs and are worm-like in shape  but their closes relatives are spiders.
D. folliculorum are found in hair follicles and pores, whileD. brevis resides deeper down in our skins sebaceous glands.
The mites closest relative are spiders (Picture: Getty)
While the mites are assumed to be harmless, they have been known to exacerbate a skin problem called rosacea  which can give sufferers spots and a red appearance.
People more prone to rosacea have been found to be home to more mites, in some cases ten times more than average.
They come out at night time and mate (Picture: Getty)
There are treatments available to get rid of the face mites. But the feisty creatures will be back within six weeks.
Thoemmes added: They most certainly have an effect on us, as we do on them.
We could be having immune responses to them, which could have been having an effect on our health and immune systems.

Yves Rossy, who is known as the Jetman and protg Vince Reffet appear seriously reminiscent of Tony Stark as they don winged kerosene powered jet-packs to fly through the skies of Dubai.
The pair are dropped out of a helicopter before their engines kick in and they can be seen soaring through the skies of the idyllic city.

And to give some perspective as to how high theyre flying, they can be seen zooming past the Burj Khalifa, which is the worlds tallest building at 2,722 foot.
Its seriously impressive, but wed be petrified about the possibility of engine failure if it was up there.
What a view! (Picture: REUTERS/Lara Sukhtian)
Explaining the idea behind the incredible stunt, Rossy said: Jetman is the culmination of over 20 years of innovation and has resulted in achieving my personal dream to fly free, soaring through the sky.
It is a privilege to have a talented athlete like Vince fly besides me high in the sky and I believe that together we will make great advances as we move towards our next big milestone.

A woman claims she was thrown out of a shopping centre for wearing sunglasses.
Claudia Jordan posted an Instagram video of her walking into Auburn Mall in Alabama, US, when shes stopped by a security guard.
He says: Unless you have a medical problem youll have to take off your sunglasses.
The shopper then posts a second clip that shows her being walked out of the mall flanked by staff.
Claudia claims she was kicked out on racist grounds. However, it is clear that the security guards ushering her and her group out of the building are a mix of black and white men.
She wrote: Never go to the Auburn Mall if youre a minority and you chose to wear sun glasses. Clearly its against the law if you are black.
Meanwhile we saw two white women and a white man wearing sunglasses who were not harassed or even approached. There were no signs saying that sun glasses were not allowed.

DONT LOOK AT IT! Some people think that this book contains a drawingby Lucifer himself, and happens to be cursed.
The Codex Gigas, which is the largest medieval manuscript in the world, is nine inches thick and 36 inches tall.
But its shrouded in mystery as a result of an eerie image of the devil contained within, leading many to believe that the book was written under eerie circumstances.
SPOOKY.
Legend has it that the book was created when a monk from the Middle Ages was due to be bricked up, after he broke monastic vows.
But in order to avoid the punishment, he promised to write a book containing all human knowledge in a single night.
However, as midnight approached, he turned to the devil and asked for help, and offered his soul in exchange for being able to finish the book.
The whopping book is 36 ins tall and weighs 165lbs (Picture: Getty)
The devil agreed, and even signed the work by adding a self-portrait of himself.
Although the story sounds like something from a horror film, its authenticity was given a boost by a National Geographic report which revealed that handwriting analysis had suggested that a single scribe had composed the entire manuscript.
And a hermann inclusis signature in the text suggests that there was only a single author.

The books contents also seem in keeping with the legend, as it contains five long texts along with the complete bible.
But some researchers have rubbished the story, and instead claim that it was created by a monk who decided to devote his work to the text.
You can read a digitised version of the book here , but we wont be held responsible for any subsequent demonic possessions.

For his parents 50th wedding anniversary he bought them a first class trip to Hawaii for 12 days full of fun and adventure  he also paid for all their meals and gave them extra money for tipping!
However it was Nicks revealwhich really stole the show.
He presented them both with Leis (traditional Hawaiian garments), and a mocked up a poster from the film Joe Versus the Volcano (a film set in the Pacific islands) replacing the faces of Tom Hank and Meg Ryan with those of his parents, renaming it the Raymonds Vs the Volcano.

Some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are purposely designed to be aesthetically magnificent any time of day.
The Houses of Parliament and the Colosseum in Rome both look spectacular in daylight, however they take on a whole different atmosphere when illuminatedatnight.
New York photographer Richard Silver has decided tocapture famous buildings in various stages of light with a technique he calls time slice.
The long exposureshots spliced together show the round-the-clock beauty of some of mankinds greatest constructions.

Richard, from New York, said of his technique: I never really thought about the effect time slicing has on the architecture until I shot the Gateway to India in Mumbai.
The light cast by the sunset on the Gateway was so linear to the structure that I needed to take extra photos so it would not interfere with what I was trying to accomplish.

They endure their chemotherapy treatments together  even making the process fun.
Pennys mother, Cindy Sagan, told ABC News : It was like a play-date. Even though she was getting chemo, she was getting poked, it was stressful. It was easy going [to the hospital] knowing she was having fun.

Avas mother,Christina Garcia, added: It just made her more comfortable. She wasnt scared because she looked like her.
Penny got to enjoy having a best friend. Ava got to enjoy that and Penny will forever be in our hearts and we will always remember her.

Sadly, the parents dont know how much longer their children have to live.
They hoped the girls could celebrate remission together, but Pennys health has deteriorated.

Sugar may be called something different in the ingredients list (Picture: Alamy)
If youve been reading food packaging to avoid sugars and take in more wholegrain you may have actually been doing the opposite.
An article from Readers Digest has shone light on various questionable practices that involve disguising sugars by using alternative names and utilising green labelling to convince people products are healthier.
(Instead of sugar) they might put evaporated cane juice, dextrose high fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, said Readers Digests editor in chief Liz Vaccariello when talking about the 50 Secrets Food Manufacturers Wont Tell You story.
Theyll use two or three different kinds of sugar so the word sugar isnt the first thing on the ingredients list.

And dont assumeproducts with green on them arehealthy due to their colour, Vaccariello addedon CBS This Morning.
According to the article companies have been known to exploit this perception by using green on food items that are not that good for you.
Cheese lovers will also be interested to know they may not actually be eating the dairy product, according to author Melanie Warner, who was one of the experts interviewed.

Theres a difference between this wholegrain rice and something that is multigrain (Picture: Alamy)
To save money and simplify the production process, manufacturers take out some of the milk and replace it with processed milk protein concentrate or whey protein concentrate, shesaid.
And if you were thinking multigrain was the same as wholegrain you would be wrong.
Multigrain normally just means the product contains many types of grain.
Now youre armed with the facts, dont make the same mistakes.

Its taken years, but people in China are finally ditching traditional medicines in favour of Viagra to get a hard-on.

Experts believe so many live with the debilitating issue because of lifestyle choices which commonly include a lack of exercise.

Anyway, if you have more time on your hands than the President, youll have time to memorise all 50 states  and test your knowledge.
Once youre finished with the states, you can take on the capitals.
Then youll know that New Mexicos capital is Santa Fe not Albuquerque. Andthe capital of New York state is not New York city. Oh no. Its Albany, folks.

Finda random debate from the US Senate or House of Representatives onthe C-Span YouTube channel  ideally with a vote at the end.
The rules are as follows:
1. Every time a state with a direction (North, South or West) is mentioned  drink twofingers.
2. Every time either of the Dakotas are mentioned  downyour drink.
3. Every timeNew features in a name (i.e.New York, New Jersey and New Mexico)  drink one finger.
4. Every time Rhode Island or Delaware are mentioned  downyour drink.
5. Every time Mississippi is mentioned, you haveto spell it correctly but if you get it wrong  you downyour drink
You can add more drinking rules of your own but it would be ill-advised.

At first glimpse, this video seems like something out of a gruesome horror movie, as the legs of a mysterious monster are seen emerging from the roof of a store in Hong Kong.
But then the identity of the beast becomes clear, as a wild boar comes crashing through the roof of the childrens clothing store and becomes trapped.
Ill take that little black number in a size 16 please (AP Photo/Apple Daily)
Theres also a rational explanation as to why the boar was in the store initially  as the animals are known to inhabit the forested hills surrounding Hong Kong and can run at up to 20mph.
This particular boar, a young female, only damaged a few mannequins and escaped unscathed, but drew a large crowd who presumably wanted to watch the closest thing possible to a bull in a china shop.

If true, the research could hold the key for infertile men around the world (Picture: Getty)
Human sperm cells have been created in a lab for the first time  giving hope to infertile men, French researchers say.
Science has always struggled to find a way to turn male fertility cells, known as spermatogonia, into mature sperm.
The process  which happens in the testes  normally takes around 70 days in the body.
During this time, the bodies of some men suffer from nonobstructive azoospermia  or abnormal sperm production  andwill not be able to turn the sperm fertile.
Why we shouldn't be celebrating the research just yet
Professor Allan Pacey, of Sheffield University, said: This is a bold claim to make and we have had our fingers burnt before with people making this claim.
Until I see a peer-reviewed scientific publication showing unequivocally that this has been done, I have to remain sceptical.
Claims like this can often cause heartache for infertile couples who see them as hope only to have their hopes dashed later when it doesnt translate into an available procedure.
But this new research, which has not been officially verified, suggests that this process can be replicated in a lab environment.
Isabelle Cuoc, CEO of Kallistem, said: Kallistem is addressing a major issue whose impacts are felt worldwide: the treatment of male infertility.
Our team is the first in the world to have developed the technology required to obtain fully formed spermatozoa [sperm] in vitro with sufficient yield for IVF.
This is a major scientific outcome that enhances both our credibility and our development potential.
We are targeting a global market worth several billion euros in which there are currently no players.

However, professor Allan Pacey, a male fertility expert from the University of Sheffield, has urged infertile men not to pin their hopes on this research.
He said that such studies do not translate into readily available procedures  and it could be some time before this happens.

Cheeky snakes.
When theyre not trying to make you eat fruit that youve explicitly been told not to eat, theyre stealing yourfish.
In this instance, it was Cindy Krullers young son who had his catch stolen.
According to Mrs Kruller, the snake seized its chance for a free snack when the fish unhooked itself.

My son caught a little perch, reeled it up to the shore and as it flopped around, it unhooked itself, Mrs Kruller wrote under a video posted to YouTube.
As soon as that happened, a garter snake comes out of nowhere and grabs it!
Fortunately, the snake ended up dropping the fish, allowing the boy to pick it back up and put it back in the water.
That was amazing, mom. You have to put that on YouTube, he says.

You want to go to the prom but you dont have a date.
Who do you turn to?
ForDrew Holm, it was his 93-year-old great-grandmother, Katie Keith.
A thrilled Mrs Keith said it had been 75 years since she had been to her own high school leaving dance.
She told Wave 3 news : I went to mine back in 1940.
Nobody had formals. We all just went in our going-to-church dresses and what we had.
The date came about after shed been joshing her dateless great grandson, saying: Well, Ive got a dress, Ill go with you.

However, Drew took her at her word and came over later to formally ask her to be his date.
The Indiana high school junior said: She was like, No, go find someone prettier.
I was like, No, I cant do that. Youre the prettiest woman.
They said the age limit was 21 so I had to talk to the principal about it and stuff.

After inviting his great grandma, Drew did find a girlfriend but he decided to take his great-gran anyway, and met up with his new girlfriend at an after-prom event at thelocal bowling alley.
If youre wondering if they cut up some rug, well let Mrs Keith answer that burning question: Everybody got up, you know, and they were doing this shuffle thing.
And Drew said to me, Lets dance, grandma. Will you dance?.
I said, Sure. So him and I got out there and shuffled right along with them.
Leg-end.

Josh Fairbanks recently thought his 12-year-old son was taking longer than usual in the shower recently, and decided he wanted to get to the bottom of it.
Clearly unaware that 12-year-old boys need their private time (seriously Mr Fairbanks, do we have to spell it out for you?), the joker crept into the bathroom and filmed one of his sons longer-than-normal showers.
Rather than doing something we cant possibly mention (but know you are all thinking), Loganwas fine-tuning his mad dance/crowd-revving skills (theyjust had a blue-tooth speaker installed).
His good times are quickly ruined when he realises his father is filming him, bringing the show(er) to an abrupt end.

Hackers have placed pornographic images of children on a concentration camp memorial website on the 70th anniversary of the Nazis defeat.
The Mauthausen memorial website was up again on Friday after the offensive content was removed, and the site confirmed an investigation intothe malicious attack on theformer concentration camp in western Austria had started.
Much to our regret we must inform you that the website of the Mauthausen memorial has been hacked with a child pornography context, a statement said.
The company in charge of our website has deactivated it immediately.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior condemns the attack on the website of the Mauthausen Memorial and has initiated investigations.

Austrian interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner was shocked by the attack and added: Interior ministry experts are helping the private operator of the website as we speak to get the site back up as soon as possible.
At the same time an investigation is under way.
Austria was annexed by Hitlers Germany in 1938 and they were finally defeated inearly May 1945.
Over the decades, Austrian public opinion has slowly shifted from considering the country a victim of the Nazis to recognition that it was complicit in the regimes crimes.
Hundreds of thousands died at Mauthausenand its subsidiaries.

A presidential candidate in the Polish elections whose party allied with Ukip in the European Parliament has called for the legalisation of child pornography.
Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who lost yesterdays election, said that child abusers should be severely punished, and added that pornography not created as a product of child abuse should be legalised.
I can buy pornography at home, I can look at it, I can even have child pornography on my computer, he told the Telegraph.
I very strongly object to abuse of children, but that has nothing to do with child pornography. If you create child pornography absolutely in the computer within any child being abused, is it OK or not?
He continued: It should not be punished. Looking at that is not punishable, it is not punishable to abuse children.

Mr Kormin Mikke, 72, a self-styled anti-regime candidate lost out in yesterdays election to President Bronislaw Komorowski and conservative challenger Andrzej Duda, who will face a run off to determine the countrys next leader.

Cries from a little girl could be heard and an elderly couple were also seen fleeing for their lives.
Strangely there were some people who didnt seem worried at all and continued to take snaps even when the black bears were a few metres away.
But even they were forced to flee when mama bear got a bit too close for comfort.
The incident didnt look that terrifying and no-one was hurt but expert Bob Gibson told NBC News things could have got deadly.
These tourists were absolutely in danger, he said.
Black bears are usually shy of people. But you put them with their cubs and they get really protective. You never want to be between a bear and its cub.

The 36-year-old was told shed have to get an abortion before she could get a full MRI so decided against it, with doctors then unsuccessfully operating on her spine.
Lily will get to hear her mothers voice and see video of her via an app created by director Christopher Henze, who made a documentary featuring Mrs Joice, called 40 weeks

A man has come forward to claim that as a child he was told to dress up and perform oral sex by a psychologist under the guise of curing his asthma.
Terence Kirkpatrick visited theRoyal North Shore Hospital in Sydney in 1967, at the age of 11, to be treated for his asthma.
Now, nearly 60 years later, an inquiry has been held into this incident, along with the alleged lax attitude towards protecting children in the hospital during this time.
Mr Kirkpatrick told the hearing about his interaction with psychologist Stuart Frank Simpson: My mother waited outside the consulting room in the waiting area.
Simpson would have sit back in a chair. He would say relax, close your eyes.
I understand now that he was trying to hypnotise me, but I didnt really know what was going on. Simpson would then make me dress up, photograph me, and make me perform oral sex.

Next time youre sipping from a glass of water, be gratefulthat youre not a baby elephant.
As this video shows, even a simple trip to get a drink can be a slog.
Footage taken at South Africas Madikwe Game Reserve shows three baby elephantsgettingstuck in the mud in their eagerness to get to the watering hole.
But evenafter they get unstuck, one little elephant charges straight into the watering hole  and finds himself stuck for a second time.
Kristoff Potgieter, 28, nicknamed the elephants Hughey, Dewey and Louis after characters from the animated TV series Duck Tales.

Say cheese! Picture: Reuters)
Considering that hes been pretty busy in his capacity as President of the United States, its hardly any wonder that Barack Obama has only just got round to finishing the mammoth task of visiting every US state while in office.
But by finally vising South Dakota on Friday, the President completed the task of visiting all 50 states in the US, and joked that he was saving the best for last.
To the other 49, I hope you take no offence, he said.
Hes now become only the fourth president to set foot in every U.S. state, after Richard Nixon completed the feat in less than three years, and George W. Bush completed it in a single term.
And just before the visit, the White House shared a heart-warming letter from one young girl, who was seriously upset that he hadnt got round to visiting.

Rebecca Kelly was seriously annoyed that the President hadnt visited, and proudly wrote We have Mount Rushmore, and spoke of the coyotes, hawks and bald eagles that she would often see.
BUT THEN THIS HAPPENED, AND HE MET HER.

Weve all wanted to have contact with a real-life Bambi that did not involve either scrapinga carcass off acrumpled car bonnet or watchingit being chased by an dog named Fenton .
Well, this lucky chapenjoyed this relaxed encounter with a wild doe outside his friends cabin in Virginia in the Eastern United States.
As he tickled and stroked her, the deer responded happily, only running away once heleft the clearing.
Needless to say this is one Disney-esque encounter we would all like to replicate ideally with a cute but precocious rabbit watching on.

If only these were the cars involved (Picture: AP Photo)
They do have speed limits abroad, all Fast and Furious wannabes out there.
Speeding in France does have consequences as these five British drivers found out after being tracked down by a police helicopter.
They had been driving their top of the range Porsches and Lamborghini to Biarritz, in south west France, when they were seen over-taking everybody else on the packed road.
These included the plain clothes police chief who, on a day off, was in his private car and saw the cars going past at well over the 80mph limit.
MORE: This mayor imposed a 20mph speed limit and then got done for speeding
He immediately called his colleagues on his mobile phone, and they scrambled a chopper to try and catch the drivers, who were travelling towards Hendaye in France, and then on to Saragossa in Spain on Friday afternoon.
A police spokesman said: The speeds were so high that we had to call in the Gendarmerie helicopter in Bayonne to intercept them.
When the drivers saw the helicopter following them, they began to slow down, allowing police car patrols to get near.
All were finally pulled at a toll booth, where they were given speeding fines, and warned they could have their cars confiscated if they carried on.
No speed radars were used in the pursuit, but officers are certain that all were travelling well over 100mph.
At least half a million British motorists are flashed by speed cameras in France each year, with many punished with on-the-spot fines equivalent to just over 100 pounds.
French police collected a total of more than 1.38billion in speeding fines in 2014.
Police officers have refused to release the names of the five drivers.

This video shows the incredible moment that a blind pregnant woman was able to see her son for the first time  as a result of the amazing capabilities of 3D printing.
Tatiana Guerra, 30, from Brazil, became blind when she was 17, meaning that she would never be given the chance to see her unborn child in the womb.
In the clip, Tatiana is asked about everything she hopes that her son will experience in his life, such as the fresh breeze on his face, and is quizzed about what she thinks her son will look like.
(Picture: Huggies/YouTube)
But she is left stunned when doctors provide her with a 3D printout of the scan, allowing her to feel the unique facial features of her son, something that would have proved otherwise impossible.
And as she moves her fingers over a braille inscription which reads I am your son, she is left in tears.

The case was heard at Durban Supreme Court (Picture: Wikipedia)
A twelve-year-old boy was made to look on in horror as his mum was forced to drink petrol and set herself alight after she was suspected of witchcraft.
Appearing at Durban High Court in South Africa, the boy, now 15, told of how one man held his mother, Thembekile Ngubane, down while another forced her to drink petrol, before setting her on fire.
He claimed that Thula Dlula and Mzuyanda Mntabo held his mothers hands and assaulted her, while she was made to drink a liquid in a plastic container.
And once she was killed, a mob surrounded her body and attacked it  because they believed she was a witch.

The court also heard how another mother accused Thembekile Ngubane of shaving her sons eyebrows and cutting childrens hair in use for magic spells.
Prior to the attack, she had been asked to leave the area, but a local meeting to decide her fate quickly descended into violence.
Members of the community threw stones at her, and she was even attacked with a hammer before being killed.
Testifying at the trial, Dr Kelly Holloway from the Prince Mshiyeni Hospital said that Ngubane would have suffered an agonising death as a result of her injuries.

Three students in India have been reportedly arrested after they killed their pet dog and cooked it.
According to India Today , the three students, known only as Dholjit, Michael and Romen, were arrested after their neighbour lodged a complaint in the city of Bangalore, southern India.
He had grown suspicious over a smell coming from the students accommodation, and decided to investigate.

A family returning from Disney World were taken off a flight home after the pilot refused to fly the plane while their autistic daughter was on board.
Dr Donna Beegle was travelling home to Portland, US on a United Airlines flight when she and 15-year-old daughter Juliette were taken off at an emergency stop in Salt Lake City.
Juliette had refused to eat the food that her family had brought on board, and was eventually given a hot meal from first class after her mum argued that it would prevent any further issues.
But the family were escorted off the flight just thirty minutes later, when Dr.Beegle was told that the captain doesnt feel comfortable flying to Portland with your daughter on the plane.
In the footage of the event, other passengers can be seen decrying the decision as ridiculous, while another says Thats gonna be a lawsuit.
Donna Beegle was returning home with daughter Juliette when the incident occured (Picture: https://www.facebook.com/donna.m.beegle )
Dr. Beegle is now planning to sue United Airlines, and said she aims to highlight the issue of autism and ensure that airline employees are properly trained to work with passengers that have special needs.
In a statement, United Airlines said: After working to accommodate Dr. Beegle and her daughter during the flight, the crew made the best decision for the safety and comfort of all of our customers and elected to divert to Salt Lake City after the situation became disruptive.

Parkour, or free running, is pretty dangerous, however nothing we have ever seen quite matches up to this.
Famed free runner/madman Oleg Cricket recently filmed himself gleefully jumping a few gaps on a tower in Dubai.
Of course beneath these gaps was about a 50ft drop.
Yeah, there were a few swimming pools below him, but the odds of him landing in one if he fell (or surviving that fall at all) are pretty slim.
It goes without saying  please dont try this at home, Oleg is a professional.
He has gained a legion of fans with his outrageous parkour moves and stunt work.

A diver has caught the moment he wentmano-a-mano with a great white shark on camera.
Zack Spurlock was fishing off the coast of Florida when he noticed he was sharing the water with something slightly bigger than the fish or himself.
Armed only with a spear, Zachwas forced to fight off the razor-toothed beast, and managed to film the nail biting confrontation with his Go Pro.
The massive shark is initially scared off by Zachs bravado only to reappear within a few feet of the terrifying diver moments later.

The water was crystal clear here so its amazing to me how incredible these large creatures are at staying in your blind spot.

We lust for this super-food (Picture: Getty)
The world was warned, but we never thought the day would come.
Instead we gorged ourselves on avocados like they were never going to run out.
Well, now its judgement day.
The popularity in avocados has more than tripled in the past three decades  which will explain why theyre so expensive and more of a shopping basket treat than a necessity.
Today burrito chain Chipotleuses about 97,000 avocados a day, or about 35 million pounds per year alone.
WONT SOMEONE THINK OF THE GUAC!? (Picture: REX Shuttershock)
As demand grows for the super-food, as does land to farm them.
California in the US produces a billion pounds of the good stuff from March to September, but around 98 per cent of California in the US is currently in a drought, report The Independent .
The process is draining groundwater and wells in other parts of the world because it takes 318 litres of water to produce 1lb of avocados.
This means theres a very real possibility of an avocado shortage.

A scare in2014 got so serious that Chipotle announced that it wouldsuspend serving guacamole.

However, its worth noting that participants outlook on sex is likely to change when instructed to have intercourse. People may feel like its more of a chore and something spontaneous to be enjoyed.
George Loewenstein, study author, said: Perhaps couples changed the story they told themselves about why they were having sex, from an activity voluntarily engaged in to one that was part of a research study.
If we ran the study again we would try to encourage subjects into initiating more sex in ways that put them in a sexy frame of mind.

This incredible timelapse shows the remarkable transformation of a pet puppy that defied the odds and made it into adulthood  despite her owner being told that she was unlikely to survive.
Pegasus the Great Dane was rescued by filmmaker Dave Meinert, after she was born with a pigment deficiency defect that can lead to deafness and blindness.
And while most of her siblings were born either dead or deformed, vets feared that she wouldnt survive.

But she has now survived to adulthood, and Daves montage captures the incredible development of the dog.
Dave, from South Africa, said that he decided to capture the video after he was told that the brave animal wasnt going to live very long.

The Golden Gate Bridge Almost Ended Up With a Bumble Bee Paint Job: The Golden Gate Bridges iconic Internati http://t.co/s7XSqyTWcm
  | News (@applestuff2u) May 7, 2015
Its one of the most iconic bridges in the world, and has been a San Francisco landmark for almost 80 years.
But the Golden Gate Bridge could have looked so different if the US Navy had got their wish to paint it like a bumblebee.
While the bridge is built out of a steel alloy, it required a paint job to protect it from rust and corrosion.
And there was also concerns that ships would smash into the 22.6 million bridge during the thick clouds of fog known to blight the area.
The Golden Gate Bridge as we know it (Picture: Wikipedia)
But despite initially rejecting the design, the Navy then proposed the bumble bee design, on the premise that it could combine with ships with similar paintwork to hide them in plain sight.
However, when the bridge steel beams arrived for construction, they had already been painted with an orange primer, which remained as the bridges iconic colour, and is now refreshed once every 20 years.
MORE: Women can orgasm from kissing, working out and giving birth
A description on the bridges website explains: The zinc protects the steel, because zinc corrodes more easily than steel. Zinc serves as a sacrificial metal, so the steel does not rust when zinc is present.
On top of that zinc primer is a top coat of paint in the Golden Gate Bridges signature colour called International Orange.

A mother has just found out that her twins actually have two different fathers.
The New Jersey woman, knownonly as T M, took a test to find out she had experienced superfecundation  a biological rarity that happens in every 13,000 cases of twins.
The story came to light when she asked the state for financial aid and, during her testimony, said within a week of sleeping with her partner she also had sex with another man.
A paternity test was ordered and the fathers were named.
It means that the twins child support must be paid separately by the two dads.

The Parkes radio telescope (Picture: Getty)
A group of scientists proved that common sense still needs to be applied regardless of how many PhDs you have.
Astronomers at theParkes radio telescope in Australia have been trying to find the source of a strange interference for the last 17 years, and they have finally figured it out.
What is Aliens? Russian satellites? No, it was their microwave.
The strange spikes only showed up once or twice a year, and at first the astronomers thought they were picking up lightning strikes.
It wasnt until a new piece of equipment was installed recently that they realised the signals were being emitted by the office microwave when someone opened the door before it had finished heating, releasing a small amount of radiation.
MORE: Sailors found guilty of pushing beer bottle up sleeping friends bum and penis-slapping his face
The telescope only picked up these perytons when it was pointing in the direction of the microwave, which is why they were so infrequent.
An embarrassed Simon Johnston, head of astrophysics at the CSIRO,told the Guardian that when signals like this are found by the telescope it ishard to pin them down.
The findings have now been reported in a scientific paper, and we assume there is a big sign on the office microwaves telling people not to open the door until it is finished.

Granola bars are meant to be healthy so its quite surprising this one came with the added ingredient of cocaine.
Police in Texas are investigating how a packet of the drug ended up in the wrapped food item.
Cynthia Rodriguez, of San Antonio, said she was eating the Nature Valley bar when a small green bag emblazoned with dollar signs fell out.

Thinking she had won a Willy Wonka-style prize she contacted manufacturer General Mills, but the company told her to call police.
Its a somewhat disturbing case, Sargent Javier Salazar, from the San Antonio Police Department, told KENS 5.
He added: You think of a child getting a hold of a package thats got interesting symbols on it, dollar signs in this case, and ingesting something like cocaine that could have a possibly dangerous effect, maybe even deadly on a child.
General Mills said it was confident the cocaine was not packaged with the bar at a company factory, but that brings little comfort to Rodriguez, who has three of her 11 grandchildren living with her.

He was eventually ordered to pay money to the store after pleading no contest to charges.

Meet Hitlers nephew, Willy, who fought against him
Today is Victory in Europe Day, aka VE Day.
Because Tuesday, May 8, 1945 was a life-changing day for millions of people all over the globe.
The day marked the end of World War II in Europe and the end of six years of sacrifice, death and endurance.
VE Day is a day to reflect on the horrors of war and remember how close the world came to being permanently oppressed by Hitler and the Nazis.
And in 2015 its also the VE Day 70th anniversary.
Weve all sat through long lessons about the wars key dates, the politics and the battles, but theres a few things your history teacher probably didnt tell you.
Heres 12 things you never knew about WWII.
1. Technically WWII is still going
Because of a long-running dispute between Russia and Japan over theKuril islands, the two countries have not yet signed a treaty to end the war.
2. Fanta was born in the war
The Germans had a hard time getting hold of Coca-Cola syrup because of a trade embargo.
So Coca-Cola Deutschland created a new drink from more available ingredients, including whey and pomace.
The team were urged to use their imagination, or phantasie in German, and so Fanta was born.
3. British spies tried to spike Hitlers food with female hormones to feminise him
Agents planned to smuggle oestrogen into Hitlers food to make him less aggressive and more like his docile younger sister Paula, who worked as a secretary.
Professor Brian Ford wrote about this in his book Secret Weapons: Technology, Science And The Race To Win WWII.
4. The first British casualty of Nazi bombing was a rabbit
According to one eye-witness , the only thing to be hurt by the first bomb was a bunny.
5. Americans and Germans united to fight the SS at one point
On May 5, 1945, US forces liberated Castle Itter in Austria, which was being used as a prison for French VIPs including ex-prime ministers Paul Reynaud and Eduard Daladier.
When the SS arrived to recapture it and kill the prisoners, the outnumbered American soldiers were joined by anti-Nazi German soldiers of the Wehrmacht and wives and girlfriends of the French VIPs.
Stephen Harding has written about it in The Last Battle.
6. The Grand Mosque Of Paris helped Jews escape the Nazis
(Picture: Getty)
The mosques underground caverns hid resistance fighters and French Jews until they could be given certificates of Muslim identity.
Meanwhile, upstairs, rector Si Kaddour Benghabrit Benghabrit was giving tours of the mosque to Nazi officers and their wives to throw them off the scent.
The story has been told in French film Free Men.
7. Hitlers nephew was born in Liverpool and fought for the Allies
Willy Hitler was the son of Hitlers half-brother, Alois, and Irish-woman Bridget Dowling.
After a spell in Nazi Germany, during which time he tried to blackmail Hitler, among other things he wrote an article for Londons Look magazine called Why I Hate My Uncle.
He later moved to the US, where he joined the navy in 1944 as a pharmacists mate then a hospital corpsman.
After being wounded in action he was discharged in 1947 and awarded a Purple Heart medal.
8. The French cut the Eiffel Towerslift cables to give Hitler a hard time
When German forces moved into Paris, the French cut the cables so soldiers would have to walk up to fly the swastika.
During his visit, Hitler chose to stay on the ground rather than take the steps.
9. Oscars were made of painted plaster during the war
The statues were normally britannia metal plated in copper, nickel silver and 24-karat gold but metal shortages made this unfeasible.
After the war, though, theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences invited winners to swap their plaster figures for gold-plated ones.
10. Hitler planned to turn Moscow into a lake
Hitler wanted its 4 million inhabitants killed, the area levelled and covered by a large artificial lake which would permanently submerge it by opening the sluices of the Moscow-Volga Canal.
11. Double agent Joan Pujol Garcia received an Iron Cross from the Germans and an MBE from the British
The Spanish spy was on the side of the Allies, and had the code name Garbo, after Greta Garbo.
He did his job so well the Nazis never realised they had been fooled and gave him the high honour, usually reserved for front-line soldiers.
12. The Americans renamed hamburgers Liberty Steaks
To get away from the German-sounding name, US restaurants rebranded their beef patties for something more patriotic.

Pat Laughlin, aka Big Daddy proved he has all this and more recently with this ridiculous speeding leapfrom one bike to another.
He performed the stunt onthe mini-mega ramp in China  and it wasnt even part of a competition (so we assume he was just doing it for a laugh).
It is unlikely you have a ramp of this size in your home, but if you do, please DONT TRY THIS AT HOME!

RIP, Siren
The Saudi Arabia Starbucks logo is pretty morbid.
It looks like the mythical Siren hassnuffed itand her crown is left bobbing ominously in the ocean at night.
Sheesh, thanks for the skinny latte with a sprinkling of depression, Starbucks.
Coffee enthusiasts have long speculated that the original logo is too raunchy to be displayed in the deeply religious and conservative part of the world.
The logo we all know and love (Picture: PA)
The Starbucks logo story
This is the story behind the logo, according to the official Starbucks blog. Although, but its still as clear as mud.
Lets go all the way back to 1971, to when Starbucks was first coming to be.
In a search for a way to capture the seafaring history of coffee and Seattles strong seaport roots, there was a lot of poring over old marine books going on.
Suddenly, there she was: a 16th century Norse woodcut of a twin-tailed mermaid, or Siren.
There was something about her  a seductive mystery mixed with a nautical theme that was exactly what the founders were looking for. A logo was designed around her, and our long relationship with the Siren began.
Over the last 40 years weve made some changes to that identity. Now were doing that again, to keep ourselves relevant as we evolve without ever losing sight of our heritage.
But the Siren has always been there. She is at the heart of Starbucks.

The makers wanted to preserve Einsteins even flow and soft curves (Picture: Kickstarter)
Youll probably never be able to think like Einstein, but you may able to write like him  on your computer, that is.
A Kickstarter project has been launched to create a font based upon the writing of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist.
The makers, typographer Harald Geisler and dancer Elizabeth Waterhouse, wanted to take Einsteins handwriting and turn it into a font that preserved itsclear rhythm, even flow and soft curves.
Its just very nice handwriting, said Phil Marshall of the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at SLAC Stanford University.
The makers say the money represents about six months worth of design work (Picture: Kickstarter)
Einsteins equations were beautiful, so it makes sense that their presentation should be as well.
The project has so far raised $13,199 of the $15,000 goal.
The campaign fundsrepresentsix months worth of designing, the creators said.
Our vision is to make the font even more life-like and complete, they added.
This involves creating many variations of each letter, and also adding numbers, punctuation, and even mathematical symbols.

It was 17 April 2013 when the man and his date werepulled over by Royal Oak officers and given a dressing down.
And two years to the day on17 April 2015, he and the date now his girlfriend  were pulled over again. But this time, it was under slightly different circumstances.
The police played their part perfectly,going through all the motions andfinally asking the woman if she knewwhat this is  before presenting the ring.

A spokesman for the airline said that collisions with birds are actually fairly frequent.
The damage of the nose area (radome) by bird hit is a common incident on civil aeronautical operations, said a spokesman for Turkish Airlines.
The radome area of a plane is constructed of soft materials to minimise the impact of such hits.
One can also state that the critical bird hits in aviation are the ones that occur on the engine area. Any other area of the aircraft, such as radome, wings and the hull, do not pose a risk by bird hit.

A 23-year-old mother has confessed to supplying drugs to a minor and having sex with him  just three years after she was arrested and charged with having sex with two dogs.
Brittany Sonnier, of Holly Hill, Florida, was arrested by police after the 15-year-old who lived next door told his parents they hadslept together on two occasions.
The underage teenager made the revelation after learning that Ms Sonnier had been accused of having vaginal and oral sex with two canines in 2012  because he was concerned he might have contracted a venereal disease.

Sonnier, who has a three-year-old son, told police that she had given the boy marijuana and alcohol and was charged with lewd and lascivious battery sex act with a person less than 16 years of age and contributing to delinquency of a minor.
The Huffington Post obtained a police report in 2012 in which a former boyfriend of the young mother claimed she told him she had engaged in sexual activity with dogs and had fantasies of incest.
She went on to tell him that she has been having sex with their family dogs since she was 13 years old, the report read.

The co-pilot who deliberately crashed the Germanwings plane in the French Alps rehearsed his actions on an earlier flight in the same aircraft on the day of the disaster, an interim accident report has indicated.
In the fatal crash on March 24, co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 27, had selected just 100ft (30m) as the altitude after the captain left the cockpit of the Airbus A320, the report by French air accident bureau BEA said.
A spokesperson said: Several altitude selections towards 100ft were recorded during descent on the flight that preceded the accident flight, while the co-pilot was alone in the cockpit.

Other altitudes, including 49,000ft (14,935m) and 21,000ft (6,400m), were also selected although the plane actually descended very little during the four-and-a-half minutes the captain was away on the earlier Dusseldorf-Barcelona flight, a graph in the interim report showed.
Later on that morning, Lubitz and his 34-year-old captain had flown the return leg on the Airbus A320 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.
Cockpit voice recorder evidence has shown Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and put the Airbus A320 into a continual descent, with the plane crashing into a mountain with the loss of all 150 people on board, including three Britons.

Aldi staff in Berlin got a shock earlier this week, when they discovered a stashof cocaine hidden under a delivery of bananas.
In total 386 kilograms with a street value of $17 million (over 11 million) wasdiscovered concealed beneath boxes of bananas in 14 Aldi stores across the city.
The huge amounts in question make this the largest amount of cocaine ever seized in the German capital.
Strangely, this isnt the first time that cocaine has been accidentally delivered to an Aldi store in Germany.

A mourning dog owner has warned of the flesh-eating disease which claimed the life of his beloved pet.
Bruno contracted Alabama rot in the New Forest and died only a week later.
The disease, also known as CRGV, causes skin sores and then sudden kidney failure.
Joel was heartbroken to lose his best friend (Picture: Joel Beal)
Owner Joel Beal told the Mail Online: It began with a lesion to his paw, which he was seen for and blood works taken for more information.
In three days his condition worsened terribly at which point he was rushed into a specialist medical centre, Anderson Moores, and found to have developed renal failure.
This began on a Monday, and hed died by Saturday.

He described the loss of his best friend both shocking and painful.
Bruno died in February 2013. His death led to warnings signs being erected around the New Forest.
If the infection is spotted early it can be easily treated and the dog will make a full recovery.

Huw Stacey, head of clinical services at Vets4Pets, said:Most commonly these sores are found below the elbow or knee and appear as a distinct swelling, a patch of red skin or are open and ulcer-like.

Holidaymakers in Magaluf are on high alert this week after a huge shark was spotted swimming along the coast.
The creature  which localsclaim isa young great white due to the shape and width of its body  was seen zipping along the shallows of the Med off near-by Palmanova.
Tourists, many of whom were in Magaluf for the Bank Holiday weekend, clamoured to take pictures of the beast, sharing them on social media and questioning what the creature could be.

One picture, taken by a diving school, was published in a local newspaper under the headline:  A shark in Palmanova.
Great white sharks have been seen in Magaluf before, although it is unusual for them to be close to the shoreline.
In 1992 a great white shark was found washed up in Tossa de Mar, a Catalan resort. It died despite attempts to save it.
There are 90 species of shark found in the Spanish Med.
Shark attacks in the Med
Shark attacks in the Med are very rare  however a windsurfer was bitten in the leg in 1986 by what was believed to be a great white.His leg had to be amputated.
In 1993 another man was attacked by an unidentified two-metre-long shark and had to have several toes on one of his feet removed.

But what do they want? (Picture: Getty)
WAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
Parents will be all-too-familiar with the noise of a crying baby but very few can actually interpret what it signifies,a study has found.
Researchers at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, tried to see if adults could tell what babies want or are experiencing when they cry.
According to evolutionary psychologist Jitka Lindova, babies probably arent aware that they want to convey something and crying is simply a display of emotions orstates such as hunger, isolation or pain.
Lindova and her colleagues had 333 adults listen to 20-second recordings of babies aged five to 10 months old experiencing a range of emotions.

Playful noises were identified with greatersuccess by adults (Picture: Getty Images)
The adults could almost always tell if a baby was distressed  which makes sense given a childs survival may depend on its ability to convey that emotion  but thats where the luck seemed to end.
Volunteers turned out to be terrible at identifying specific states. Pain (a recording was taken of babies being given vaccinations) was frequently confused with isolation, while isolation was often misinterpreted as hunger.
The one emotion adults had some luck identifying was playfulness. Playful sounds were identified with 65 percent success  more than 20 percent higher than for the other records.
Play is important, Lindova explained to New Scientist .
It is practice for communication.
She believes that playful sounds may be an attempt by a baby to interact, which could explain why they are more easily identified.

Never underestimate the abilityof a class full of teenagersto ruin your life.
One35-year-old teacher probably thought a casting couch-style porn video she made under the alias Lucie would never be discovered.
How wrong she was.
The Prague Post reports that students discovered the video on the internet and, in typical fashion, sent it to all and sundry.

Soon, parents had heard about the video and were making angry phone calls to the school administrators, who fired the teacher.
I do not want to judge the teacher but it is not all right when 15-year-old children see it and gossip about it, one told IDNES .
The woman, from Ceska Lipa, believed the casting was an underwear modelling job, the Daily Mail reports, and is said to have claimed in an interview with local media that she was drugged by airborne cocaine during filmingand felt overly relaxed as a result.
Lucie says in the video that she is a mother of two and signed up to the job because she wanted totry something new.
Her contract with the school was terminated on 30 April.

CCTV caught the woman, who has not been named, leaving the naked newborn by a lamppost in Paraiba.
By chance her father came across the boy. But he didnt know he wasrescuing his grandson because the woman kept him a secret from her family.
All the dots were connected when a police appeal featured photos of the mother which were recognised by her parents and ex-boyfriendMoises Pereira Teixera.

A child aged just five was put in handcuffs and leg shackles by police after staff at his school reported that he was uncontrollable.
New York state police were called last week to a primary school in Philadelphia in New York near the Canadian border after receiving reports from teachers that five-year-old Connor Ruizwas being disruptive.
And arriving at the school, officers saw fit to place the child in handcuffs and shackle his legs before carrying him out to a patrol car.
An officer told me they had to handcuff his wrists and ankles for their safety, Chelsea Ruiz, Connors mother, told the Watertown Daily Times.

I told himthat was ridiculous. How could someone fear for their safety when it comes to a small, five-year-old child?
A spokesman for the police force defended the actions of the officers, arguing that the child was combative, out of control and was considered a danger to staff and to himself.
Jack Keller said the boy was screaming, kicking, punching and biting.
Our concern was his safety, of not only himself but the staff he was dealing with and the other students in the class where he was.

The trial of aman charged with knocking out his lawyer in a jail meeting room was delayed after he attacked his new lawyer in court.
Aaron W. Jabot, 34, was on trial on a felony assault charge after attacking his lawyer, Garfield Raymond, when he visited his client at Washington County Jail in 2014.
But Jabot was taken straight back to jail and his trial was delayed after he attackedhis new lawyer, Fred Rench, in front of around a dozen witnesses during a break in testimonyat Warren County Court. Rench was discussing an issue with Jabot at the defence table when he suddenly grabbed him and began hitting him.

Wearingformal clothing doesnt just make you look more attractive, it has mental benefits as well.
Thats according to a new study from California State University, where researchers found that donning formal wear makes you feel powerful.
A team led by psychologist Abraham Rutchickran five experiments in total, in which students wore a variety of outfits ranging in formality and took cognitive tests aimed atfinding out whether they wereprocessing information in an abstract or concrete way.

Abstract thinking and power are linked (Picture: Getty Images)
Those wearing more formal attire tended to feel more powerful and think more abstractly, i.e. they looked at the big picture and tended not to get hung up on details. The opposite was true for those wearing casual outfits.
In other words, wearing a suit caused students not just to feel capablebut to think of problems and situations as a whole, a quality that is absolutely necessary for effectiveleadership.
The findings demonstrate that the nature of an everyday and ecologically valid experience, the clothing worn, influences cognition broadly, impacting the processing style that changes how objects, people, and events are construed, the authors wrote in the journal Social Psychological &amp; Personality Science.
For most jobs, focusing on details is preferable(Picture: Getty Images)
Power involves creating social distance from others, which in turn aids abstract processing.
Power and abstract processing have been repeatedly linked to one another in literature, Rutchick told Today.
Even if you wear a suit every day, the effect doesnt diminish. Rutchick was also quick toaddthat for those not in leadership positions, focusing on details was probably apreferable mindset.

Geert Wilders, a controversialDutch politician and anti-Islamic campaigner who is on an al-Qaeda hit list was among the speakers at the event.
Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are viewed as offensive in Islam, and Western art that portrays the prophet has angered some Muslims and provoked threats and attacks from radicals.

And maybe he did takea 1,000 takes for each shot, but frankly we dont care.

This clever video shows that rescue dogs shouldnt be any less desirable than regular dogs, after they were placed on sale in a pet store.
In the video, created by Brazilian animal charity Associacao Quatro Patinhas, dogs in a regular pet store are replaced with unwanted dogs that have been rescued from the streets.
And unsurprisingly, the dogs receive a huge amount of attention as customers begin flooding into the store and begin enquiring about purchasing the adorable animals.
But they appear to be visibly shocked when the shopkeeper finally tells them that the animal is free  as long as they adopt it that is.
Aww (Picture: YouTube)
Christianne Duarte Garoui, the president and founder of Associacao Quatro Patinhas, explained that the video aimed to highlight the plight of rescue dogs in Brazil.
Animals die of diseases and maltreatment or due to overcrowding, he said.
Some people abandon animals in shelters thinking theyll get adopted and receive proper care. But they usually end up dying from many diseases and depression.

This is Cody the police dog, and hes set to become unemployed when marijuana becomes legalised in the US state of Oregon.
Thats because hell no longer be required to sniff out da erb, having previously been known to freeze in place when he suspected that someone was carrying an illegal substance.
But hes one of hundreds of police dogs in the state that will soon become surplus to requirements.
The reason, according to the Seattle Times , is that a suspect might be carrying newly-legalised marijuana alongside an illegal substance such as heroin, but the dogs could invalidate any arrest for the illegal substance if its the marijuana that they smell.
And its not possible to retrain some of the dogs either  owing to their age.

Its much harder to retrain a dog than it is to train them for the first time, Deputy Chief Brett Johnson told the Times.
Their brains develop synapses the same way human brains do. In times of stress or confusion, it becomes harder to ignore those synapses.
But theres still a faint glimmer of hope for the out-of work-dogs, as police said they could be used in cases where drugs have been smuggled across state lines.
Its kind of sad, Johnson added.
Nobody wants to see a dog lose its job.

A chauffeur who made an amateurish attempt to blackmail the Qatar royal family after finding private photos in the back of his car has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.
Awad Abdulbagy, 49, threatened to sell 350 highly sensitive pictures to a television station or to one of Qatars rivals, including Syria, after he discovered them on a camera and memory sticks following a visit to London by the Qatar royal family in 2013.
But instead of being paid the sum they wanted by Qatari embassy staff, the police were called and Abdulbagy and his wife Nasren Mohammed were arrested.

Judge Anthony Pitt called the scheme amateurish and said that the pictures included nothing disgraceful.
He did say, however, that the pictures were highly sensitive given who they belonged to, and sentenced Abdulbagy to four-and-a-half years. Mohammed, 34, was sentenced to a two-year jail sentence suspended for two years.
The couple have five children, two of whom are disabled, aged three to 11.

Mila Dago allegedly sent messages to her boyfriend that read driving drunk woo and Ill be dead thanks to you, while drunk behind the wheel of a Smart Car, a court has heard.
She then proceeded to speed through a red light and smashed into a truck driven by Benjamin Byrum, 51.
But while Dago and Byrum were fortunate to survive the crash, 22-year-old Irina Reinoso, Dagos passenger, was killed.

A Mexican soldier was blown into the sky when strong winds caught a giant national flag he was holding during a military ceremony.
Members of the armed forces were helping to raise the enormous red, white and green Mexican flag during the ceremony in Durango, north of Mexico City, when a gust of wind took hold.
Though the majority of thoseraisingthe flag were able to let go, one soldier failed to do so and was launched high into the air before crashing back down to the ground.
The flag acted like a parachute to some degree as the soldier fell but he still hit the groundat some speed. Fortunately, he wasnt seriously hurt.
The strange thing is that the flagpole was inaugurated in Durango at the beginning of April and this is the second accident, said local media.

A Charlie Hebdo cartoonist whose picture of Muhammad adorned thefront cover a week after terrorists murdered several members of staff has vowed never to draw the prophet again.
Rnald Luzier, known by the pen name Luz, was late to work on the day that two Islamist gunmenstormed the Paris offices of the satirical weekly and killed twelve people including five staff cartoonists  due to depictions of the prophet Muhammad that the pair deemed to be offensive and blasphemous.
A week after the massacre, Luzier drew an image of the prophet holding a sign reading Je suis Charlie for the front cover of the survivors edition of the magazine. But he now says that he will not draw Muhammad again  and says that fear of violent reprisal isnt the reason why.
I will no longer draw the figure of Muhammad. It no longer interests me, he told Les Inrockuptibles magazine.
Je suis Charlie became a slogan for supporters of freedom of speech (Picture: Peter&lt;br /&gt;Parks/AFP/Getty Images)
Im not going to spend my life drawing him.
The survivors issue of Charlie Hebdo had a print run of eight million, a record for the French press.
The phrase Je suis Charlie (I am Charlie) has been adopted as a slogan by supporters of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
Luz told Les Inrockuptibles that the terrorists didnt win.
They will have won if the whole of France continues to be scared, he said.

But the 16-year-old had not reckoned on the good moral judgement of his own mother.
She shopped him to police after watchingCCTV of her incident andrecognising him.
According to KABTV the teen then confessed to stealing the tablet from the toddler in Houston, Texas.
Police are now investigating if the youth is involved in a number of similar car park robberies.

Council meetings are pretty boring, however that doesnt mean council workers dont enjoy a bit of toilet humour.
During what looks like a particularly dullcouncil meeting in Texas recently a councilman took a quick bathroom break.
Unfortunately quiet decorum gave way to fits of laughter because the councilman had left his mic on, broadcasting the sounds of him relieving himself into the council chambers.
Poor Rachael Jonrowe  she is trying so hard to talk about something important, but just cant keep a straight face.
When the councilman returns his embarrassed colleagues explain his faux pas.
Lets just be thankful he didnt have to go number two.

The young sea lion, which was named Rubbish by animal shelter volunteers, was found hiding underneath a car in the Marina District of San Francisco on Thursday evening.
After police and animal rescue crews were called to the scene, the plucky mammal was reluctantly coaxed from the vehicle, with amazed passers-by filming the dramatic rescue.
But it isnt the first time that the sea lion pup ventured away from the ocean, with reports suggesting that Rubbish was found washed up on the shore earlier this year, suffering from pneumonia and severe malnourishment.
Hes now looking a lot more healthy (Picture: Sarah van Schagen/The Marine Mammal Center via AP)
This time around, he was released back into the wild after a big feed resulted in him gaining a healthy 17 pounds.

Looks pretty luxurious (Picture: TripAdvisor)
It might not be The Savoy, and you certainly wont be able to order a beer from the bar, but Isis have opened their first hotel in the Iraqi city of Mosul.
The Ninawa hotel was previously described on TripAdvisor as the best hotel in Iraq  boasting an opulent reception area, tennis courts, and a swimming pool.
But despite ISIS closing down all hotels in captured territories, the hotel has now been reopened, with all 262 rooms reserved for visiting commanders.

And the luxury hotel will also be available for weddings  so that jihadi brides can marry Islamic State militants on the former 65-a night site.
Fancy a dip? (Picture: TripAdvisor)
As for the facilities, women will be banned for swimming or playing tennis in public unless they keep every inch of flesh covered, while the hotel is likely to be patrolled by members of IS feared all women police brigade.
Other banned activities including drinking alcohol, dancing, smoking or gambling, and those who dont obey risk being flogged, crucified or beheaded.
A 2013 TripAdvisor review of the hotel hailed it as amazing.

Just why? (Picture: presseportal.de)
Its such a pain when a mass of commuters stops you from boarding a train, and even more so when it is a brick wall.
Police in Hamburg, Germany, had to deal with this problem recently when some prankster built a brick wall in the door of a train recently.
After spending 12 hours and10,000 (7,300) removing the wall, they still have no idea who created it, or why.
Passengers were immediately asked to leave the train when the wall was discovered, however it appears no one witnessed the wall being built.
(Picture: presseportal.de)
(Picture: presseportal.de)
Police said the bricks were attached to each other with an adhesive and applied in the door area to the door panel with appropriate adhesive.
Whether it was intended as a prank or some art, police have simply labelled the act as vandalism, and say the perpetrator could face up to five years in prison or a hefty fine if caught.

Ishwor Ghimire rescued 55 orphans
This is Ishwor Ghimire, and hes been hailed as a hero, after leading 55 orphans to safety in the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake.
The 19-year-old was having lunch at the Nepal Deprived Women and Children Upliftment Centre Orphanage in Kathmandu, shortly before the earthquake struck the capital last Saturday.
But as the earthquake began, he immediately gathered all 55 and led them to safety, while personally carrying the younger children.
Speaking to MIC, he explained: All the kids were so panicked and started screaming and crying.
These 55 orphans were rescued by Ishwor Ghimire
I asked everybody to get out from the building. The earth was still shaking but I was running here and there to rescue all the kids and take them to the safety place.
And once out, Ghimire helped to construct a small, plastic tent in a nearby garden, to act as temporary shelter.
But perhaps most remarkably, Ghimire was visiting the orphanage because he grew up there, before receiving a scholarship to study at Pulteney Grammar School in Adelaide, Australia last year.
Shelter was set up for the orphans
He had returned to mentor children at the orphanage, and Pulteney Grammar School is now raising funds to rebuild the orphanage.
The death toll of the earthquake, which is worst Nepal has seen in more than 80 years, has now surpassed 6,000.

A man has admitted sexually assaulting a male partygoer who passed out during a boozy pool party in Las Vegas.
Gustavo Banegas, 22, pleaded guilty to the attack which took place in a bathroom at the MGM Grand Hotel, one of Las Vegass most iconic venues.
According to police, a hotel security guard walked into the bathroom, close to the entrance of the Wet Republic pool party and discovered a male adult who appeared to be attempting to have anal sex with an unresponsive white male adult.
And when questioned by police, Banegas admitted that he found the victim passed out drunk and sitting on the toilet with the shorts pulled down to his ankles.
After lifting the man from the toilet, he reportedly became immediately turned on, and began to masturbate while standing next to the sink.
Although Banegas admitted performing oral sex on the man, the security guard who walked in on the assault told police that Banegas was appearing to begin having anal sex with the incapacitated victim.

Six police officers will face criminal charges over the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, the citys top prosecutor has said.
State attorney Marilyn Mosby said that Grays death was a murder, and the arrest warrants for all six officers involved have now been issued.
Office Caesar Goodson has been charged with second-degree murder, while separate charges including manslaughter and misconduct in public office were brought against five other police officers.
Delivering the decision at a press conference in Baltimore, Mosby said that the 25-year-old had suffered a fatal neck injury when he was handcuffed inside a police van, without being strapped in.

She added that his arrest on 12 April was illegal, as the knife he was carrying was not a switchblade, meaning it was legal under the state law of Maryland.
To the people of Baltimore and the demonstrators across America, I heard your call for no justice, no peace, Mrs Mosby said.
Your peace is sincerely needed, as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man.

Green energy giants Tesla have announced a new range of low-cost solar batteries that they have billed as the missing piece, in the development of sustainable energy.
The pioneering batteries will retail at $3,500 in the US, and have been hailed by Tesla founder Elon Musk as a fundamental transformation in how energy is delivered across the earth.
The smallest of the two, the Powerwall is small enough to be hung inside a garage, and can store up to 10kWh of energy from wind or solar panel, and up to eight batteries can be stored in a home.
The stored battery reserves can be used during grid outages, when sunlight is low, or at times of peak demand.
Teslas Powerwall was unveiled on stage yesterday (Picture: AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu)
And the larger powerpack model can be used on a national scale, to pump electricity into the grid during periods of high demand.
Speaking as he unveiled the new Powerpacks on Thursday, Musk claimed that about two billion of the batteries could hold enough electricity to power the entire world.
That may seem like an insane number, he said.
But this is actually within the power of humanity to do.

A motorbike rider just pulled off the first triple backflip in the sports history.
A 37-foot tall takeoff ramp was positioned at a ridiculous 81-degree angle in order to give Josh Sheehan as much time in the air as possible to complete the trick.
And gunning along the ramp at a speed of 60mph, Sheehan and his 200lb bike took off, reaching a height of over 80ft andturning over three times before landing.
It was an exhilarating ride and to be the first person to ever have done this was definitely a defining moment in my career and a dream come true, Sheehan said.
His teammate, Travis Pastrana, who was the first ever to land a double backflip, called the achievement so awesome.
The slightest misstep may well have meant death, he said.

Papua New Guinea 6.8 magnitude earthquake(Picture: EPA)
A powerful earthquake has rattled the South Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea.
The 6.8-magnitude quake struck about 66 miles south-west of the town of Kokopo in north-eastern Papua New Guinea, the US Geological Survey reported.
It also said the quakes strength was lower than the initial measurement of 7.1.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said hazardous tsunami waves were possible within 186 miles of the epicentre, but the risk passed and the advisory was lifted.
There were no reports of damage or injuries, said Chris McKee, assistant director Geophysical Observatory in the capital, Port Moresby. The area closest to the epicentre is sparsely populated, and it was unlikely the quake caused any structural damage, he said.
There were also no reports of any tsunami sightings. Given the quakes depth of about 37 miles, officials believed the risk of a tsunami was slim, said observatory official Mathew Moihoi.
Shallower quakes tend to cause more damage, and have a higher potential for generating a tsunami.
Papua New Guinea sits on the Ring of Fire, the arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are common.

Smith scrolled through the social network until he found the familiar bushy-eyebrowed, bespectacled face of Mr. Boehning and started up a conversation.
The small talk quickly escalated to sexually suggestive messages. Soon he found himself with a picture of the public servants private parts. It was then that he came forward to out the politician.

Nasa has finally invented a warp drive that could take people to the moon in just a few hours.
Scientists have quietly been testing a new drive thatwould enable spacecrafts to travel faster than the speed of light.
The hope is that one day this will allow humans to reach the moon in just four hours.
(Picture: Star Trek)
The new warp drive works on an electromagnetic system, which creates thrust from electrical energy without rocket fuel.
The EmDrive engine bounces microwaves around in a closed container  providing thrust from nothing except solar energy to power the microwaves.
Technically  according to current understanding of physics  this should be impossible.
This should violate the laws of conservation of momentum, whereby the momentum of a system is constant if there are no external forces.
The implications for the new drive are huge  without needing fuel, satellites could be half the size.
Humans could also travel further into space than ever before.

Its one of the most repeated arguments used to back the anti-cannabis campaign.
But just how much of a gateway drug is marijuana?
Well, new research has shown that alcohol is actually more of a gateway drug. Much more.
Treatment4Addiction used data from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to track how people progress from one drug to harder substances.
While around 60 per cent of cannabis users went on to try other drugs, 88 per cent began with alcohol.

Half of drinkers dont go further than alcohol. This is compared to 40 per cent of marijuana users. But alcohol use dominatesmarijuana use and is a real catalyst for people going on to try harder substances.
Its worth noting that alcohol is 114 times more deadly than marijuana.

Residents of a village in Ukraine are demanding the government help them after a 100-metre-wide, 60-metre-deep sinkhole opened up, reportedly swallowing seven houses.
Salt mines built in western Ukraine 220 years ago slowly began to collect water after they were closed, dissolving underground rock formations beneath some village.
And after an enormous sinkhole measuring 100 metres across opened up in Solotvino, Zakarpatska Oblast, residentsare demanding the government move them to a safer location or take measures to stop the hole  and other, smaller ones like it  growing even larger.
The holes are getting closer to other houses all the time, said Ivan Prokop, 53.

At first, we thought it might just be one hole and it would stop, but its clear the entire region will eventually sink.
The water is gathering in the old mines, the salt deposits are dissolving and our land will continue to vanish.
Villagers say that the government hasbeen put off filling in the holesdue to the 10million cost and the seven years it will take to carry it out.
Local officials said around 24 families have already been relocated. 130 families are refusing to leave, saying that the new areas water supply is contaminated and they will be no better off.

        <Description>Crystal meth and chronic flatulence. Not what usually comes to mind when you think of Hitler.</Description>
        <MainBody>Harry Readhead for Metro.co.uk Thursday 30 Apr 2015 3:03 pm
Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), Austrian-born German statesman. 1935. Coloured photograph.
We dont need to tell you that Hitler was evil or that he was the architect of millions upon millions of innocent deaths. You know that already.
But on the 70th anniversary of Hitlers death, here are a few things about the man that you may not know.
He may have been a regular user of crystal meth
According to a 47-page wartime dossier compiled by American intelligence, Hitler took over 74 different medications, including methamphetamine, which he was prescribed for alertness. The dossier claims that Hitler took the drug before a meeting with Mussolini in 1943 and ranted for two hours without stopping.
He suffered from chronic flatulence
Historians are unanimous in agreeing that Hitler had uncontrollable flatulence. Since childhood, he suffered from stomach cramps, constipation and diarrhoea. Architect Albert Speer said that the Fuhrer would often leap to his feet during dinner and disappear to his room.
Hitler adored Snow White
He loved Disney
It may not fit in with his image as a murderous dictator, but Adolf Hitler loved Disney. He reportedly adored Snow White most of all. This may not actually be that bizarre. Many Disney films of the period can trace their origins to German folk tales. Take a look at Bavarias Neuschwanstein Castle and Sleeping Beautys Castle at Disneyland to see the similarities.
He banned smoking and had comprehensive animalprotection laws
Nazi scientists were the first people to notice a link between smoking and lung cancer. A strong anti-tobacco campaign led to banning smoking on trams, buses and city trains, promoting health education, organising medical lectures for soldiers and raising tobacco tax. And despite his complete disregard for human life, he loved animals. He was a vegetarian and passed laws that banned animal cruelty and placed more stringent restrictions on animal testing.

Hitler briefly lived within a few miles of Josep Stalin (Picture: Getty Images)
In 1913, Hitler, Stalin, Trotsky, Tito and Freud all lived within a few miles of each other in Vienna
Staling waswriting Marxism and the National Question while staying in Vienna, often meeting Leon Trotsky, who was launching the radical newspaper Pravda. Hitler was there from 1908 to1913 and struggling to make a living as a painter, while Josip Broz  later Yugoslav leaderMarshal Tito  was working as a metalworker. Sigmund Freud had moved to Vienna as a child in 1860, and left the city in 1938 when the Nazis annexed Austria.
Hitler practiced his speeches by taking photos of himself making speeches
Photographer Heinrich Hoffman was ordered by the image-obsessed Hitler to picture him miming out his speeches to see how he looked. The photos were supposed to be destroyed butHoffman kept hold of them and published them in his memoir.
Historians say Hitlers moustache is the proof this image was faked (Picture: Getty Images)
Hitler didnt always wear a toothbrush moustache
Hitler had a bushy handlebar moustache until the outbreak of World War One, when he was instructed to clip it so it would fit more snugly under a gas mask.Historians used this to prove that a famous photo of him celebrating the outbreak of war in Munich was faked.
Hitlers father changed his name from Schicklgruber
Hitlers father, Alois, was born Schicklgruber in 1837. He changed his name aged 39 to Hitler, a variant on his stepfathers surname, Hiedler.

A shocking video has emerged showing a violent altercation between a substitute teacher and a student.
The short clip, which has gone viral, opens with the teacher asking the student for her name.
It is clear that an angry exchange of words had erupted before someone began recording the incident.
The student repeatedly swears at the teacher, saying f*** you and shut the f*** up.
He calls her a coward and an argument ensues before she gets up and throws a load of books at him.
Then the teacher grabs her by the hair as her fists swing wildly.
It is unclear where in the US the incident was filmed.

If these striking imagesdont make you pay attention to the Syrian crisis, nothing will.
The series documents the lives of children, like Ali above, who have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in camps.
Ali's story
This ten-year-old has a liver disease which leaves him covered in blistering sores if hes out in the sun for too long.
His mother, Turkiya, 30, says getting help is hard: Weve been to three hospitals. At two places, they were horrified when they saw him and turned us away at the door.
At the third place we were able to see a doctor, but he couldnt do anything. He said it was too complicated.
Moyad (Picture: IBL/REX Shutterstock)
Moyad's story
The five-year-old and his mother wanted to bake a pie, so hand in hand they went to the market in Daraa to buy some flour.
They walked by a taxi where someone had placed a bomb. Moyads mother died immediately.
The boy, who was flown to Jordan for treatment, has shrapnel in his head, his back and his pelvis. He now lives at a refugee camp in Amman.

Ahmed's story
This eight-year-old is blind.
He lives in a plastic tent with his family and dreams of getting an operation so, one day, he can see.
He says: Theres a rubber tire outside our house that I like to play with. But sometimes it rolls away and I cant find it.
Maram (Picture: IBL/REX Shutterstock)
Maram's story
Maram, eight, had just come home from school when the rocket hit her house.
A piece of the roof landed right on top of her. Her mother took her to a field hospital and from there she was airlifted across the border to Jordan.
Head trauma caused a brain hemorrhage.
For the first 11 days Maram was in a coma. She is now conscious, but has a broken jaw and cant speak. Refugee camp in Amman, Jordan.
Shiraz (Picture: IBL/REX Shutterstock)
Shiraz's story
He was three-months-old when she was stricken with a severe fever.
The doctor diagnosed polio and advised her parents to not spend too much money on medicine for the girl who didnt have a chance.
Then the war came. Her mother, Leila, starts crying when she describes how she wrapped the girl in a blanket and carried her over the border from Kobane to Turkey. Shiraz, who cant talk, received a wooden cradle in the refugee camp.
She lies there. Day and night.

When we came in, one of the police said, this isnt a party, this was a drug-induced orgy, Mr King told theCalgary Herald .
The couple found underwear and condoms upstairs, with police confirming there were body fluids in the house.

The couple, who have two young children, were apprehensive about returning despite home rental company Airbnb agreeing to cover the $75,000 (48,500) damages as part of the contract.
I do feel like this requires much more than a cleaning, it requires complete restoration, Mrs King added.
The man who rented out the home could face a charge of mischief, police confirmed.

Dodos did not go extinct because they were clumsy and obsessed with watermelons (Picture: Twentieth Century Fox)
Contrary to what Ice Age would have you believe, the dodos did not go extinct because they were clumsy andoverprotective of watermelons.
They werehunted to extinction byDutch explorers who arrivedin Mauritius in 1638.
But according to new research, the dodo had a close call years before that, withthousands of the birdsand other animals dyingin a deadly cocktail of faeces and gas.
A team from the University of Amsterdam found that the Mare aux Songeson the tiny island wasonce a freshwater lake important to non-migrating animals, but began to dry up during a 50-year megadrought.

As animals crowded around the edge of the dwindling lake, sanitation became a problem, with excrement turning the area into a big toilet, in the words of paleoecologist Erik de Boer.
With the waters filled with faecal matter, poisonous algal blooms started to appear. The area became a deadly faecal cocktail and hundreds of thousands of animals were killed by intoxication, dehydration, trampling and miring.
Not the way you want to go.
Dodo numbers did gradually increase again however and it wasnt until 3800 years later that they went extinct.

The next time an airline steward asks you to turn your iPad off, dont moan that youre about to beat your top score in Candy Crush.
An iPad glitch forced 24 flights out of the air recently (dont worry, they didnt crash  they were just grounded by the pilots).
American Airlines said their flights were experiencing problems due to a problem with some of the software on the pilots iPads.
One passenger told Quartz : The pilot came on and said that his first mates iPad powered down unexpectedly, and his had too, and that the entire 737 fleet on American had experienced the same behaviour.

He said the pilot seemed shocked by the incident.
Andrea Huguely, American Airlines director of corporate communications, told USA Today: In some cases, the flight has had to return to the gate to access a Wi-Fi connection to fix the issue.
Passengers on the grounded flights were told they were free to exit the planes while the problem was sorted out, and those who did had alternative routes arranged for them.
Pilots with American Airlines carry virtual flight manuals on iPads while flying.
The airline made the digital switch in order to save fuel as weight would be drastically reduced if pilots did not have to have the 3,000 page manual in print.

Thanks Ned (Picture: Fox)
Spawns of Satan  I mean, left-handed people: No-one knows why were so different to everyone else.
But new research points to anexplanation.
Its true that 25 per cent of all left handedness can be linked by a persons genes, thanks to several studies involving twins.
However, around 100,000 people from around the world have now had their genes sequenced to determined handedness and not one gene could be singled out that is solely responsible for the causing leftitus.
Human geneticist Silvia Paracchini, from the University of St Andrews in Scotland, said: The reason why it fascinates us is that we dont really understand it. Its fascinating but also puzzling.
There must be an evolutionary advantage [to being right-handed].
MORE: Left handed pets shocker: Your pooch may be more like you than you think
She went on to explain theyve found that the DNA that influences handedness is the same that determines our bodys asymmetry.
We look symmetric, but if we look inside at our organs theres lots of asymmetry, she added.
A condition affecting one in 20,000 peoplecalled situs inversus may hold the key.
People with the conditionhave their major organs mirrored from their normal positions. So, for example, the heart would be on the right side of the body.
Paracchini and her team have found that the part of the genetic code thats abnormal in people with situs inversus is the same part that affects handedness.

A lot of fuss has been made about Ed Milibands meeting with Russell Brand.
But if you were expecting fireworks, youll be sorely disappointed.
For 15 minutes, Brand pickedMilibands brain on the political disillusionment of voters, theperceived lack of real change in Britain and other topics such as Rupert Murdoch and the governments failure to tackle tax avoiders.
Miliband, for his part, argued that meaningful change had happened in politics since universal suffrage, citingas examplesworkers rights and the NHS. He addedthat change takes time and that people should vote in order to be part of that change.

They did find common ground, however, in their criticism of the Conservatives (no surprises there) and in the disillusionment of muchof the public with politics.
The Labour leaders rivals will undoubtedly say the interview was a waste of time.
But Miliband, who was branded a joke and pathetic for agreeing to do it, may have the last laugh.

Brand said he found the interview interesting and praised Miliband for agreeing to do it (Picture: YouTube)
I genuinely didnt care enough to vote and I absolutely wasnt going to vote, but I think Ed Miliband has won me over, writes one user.
The mere fact that he agreed to do this interview shows he understands Russells point and the opinions of many of his supporters.
I love Ed Miliband for being willing to do this, adds another user.
Ed Milliband at least cares enough to turn up and talk, more than you can say for the Tory Hamster, agrees another.

While the streets of Baghdad may be scarred by bombs, Karim Wasfi proves that music can still be heard (and seen) among the destruction.
The cellist, who also happens to be thethe director of the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra, set up his instrument on the scorched street shortly after a car bomb detonated and played to a stunned crowd.
He told the BBC his action was directed at anyone who believes bombs are the only way to solve an agreement
Obviously I cannot challenge the bombs with my cello, but I can prove that life is worth living, he added.
Three car bombs went off in Iraqs capital on Monday, and are believed to have been planted by Isis militants.
Mr Wasfi argued that violence within Iraq waspreventing people from thinking clearly.

The American diet included burger and chips (Picture: Getty Images)
In one of the first studies of its kind, two groups of volunteers from different parts of the world underwent a diet swap.
20 Americans swapped burgersfor black-eyed peas when they switched diets with 20 South Africans living in rural Kwazulu, who took on the Americans eating habits.
The study at Imperial College London sought to findout if the high-fibre diet of those living in southern Africa could have an effect on the risk of developing bowel cancer.
MORE: Drastic, low-calorie diet can reverse diabetes, say experts
What They Ate
The South African diet consisted of corn fritters, spinach and red pepper for breakfast; corn dogs, fried potatoes and mango for lunch; and okra, tomatoes, corn muffins and black-eyed peas for dinner.
The American diet included beef sausage and pancakes for breakfast; burger and chips for lunch; and meatloaf and rice for dinner.
The change was dramatic. Within two weeks, the Americans riskhad beenslashed, while the South Africans began to show signs of a risk.
What is really surprising is how quickly and dramatically the risk markers can switch in both groups following diet change, Professor Jeremy Nicholson told the Independent .
These findings also raise concerns that the progressive westernisation of African communities may lead to the emergence of colon [large bowel] cancer as a major health issue.

Bowel cancer, which kills 600,000 people worldwide every year, is thought of as a Western disease because its high in red and processed meat and low in fibre.
The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests that a change in diet can positively alter the balance of bacteria found in the gut.
The African group consumed two tothree times less animal protein and fat and more carbohydrate and fibre than the Americans at the start of the study, which led to higher levels of butyrate. Butyrate is thought to have anti-cancer properties.

Is this some kind of yolk?
An extremely rare elephant bird egg is estimated to sell for 50,000 when it goes up for auction this week.
Believed to be more than 400 years old and 200 times the size of the average chicken egg, the 11.8in tall egg was laid by the now-extinct elephant bird, a flightless creature indigenous to Madagascar.
It is thought that the egg will sell for up to $76,000 (49,600) when it goes up for auction at Sothebys in London.

Its the largest egg from the largest bird that ever existed, David Goldthorpe, senior director of Sothebys books and manuscripts department, told Reuters.
It is related to the cassowary and the ostrich which are still with us today.
The elephant bird is believed to have been about three metres tall and half a tonne in weight. It went extinct between the 13th and 17th centuries due to hunting.
Mr. Goldthorpeadded that finding an egg as intact as this one was a rarity. In the 19th century, similar eggs were found in parts and reassembled.

Breathtaking: The cave as high as the London Eye (Picture: CATERS)
This beach inside a cave is mind-blowing and we want to book tickets to go there immediately.
TheHang En in Vietnam is the worlds third largest cave and as high as the London Eye.
Its also home to a jungle and a river  if a beach just isnt cutting it.
Photographer Lars Krux, 48, ventured into the cave with his wife Justyna Krux, and a party of tourists, to capture these stunning shots.
The photographer trekked 10km to get to the cave (Picture: CATERS)
Lars, from Germany, Hamburg, reached the limestone cave, close to the border of Laos, on foot after a 10km trek through the thick jungle of Phong Nha-K Bng national park.
He then had to wade waist-deep through ice-cold water to gain access to the mesmerizing cave.
The photographer said: It is hard work to access the cave, because there is no road nearby. The only way to reach the cave is to walk ten kilometers through the jungle, uphill and downhill.
You need to cross several rivers with a water level up to 1.5 meters and youll be attacked by dozens of leeches who are attaching themselves to your skin. This is certainly not to everybodys taste.

Our lord came and carried his body to heaven. His body was so tired of fighting.
He is now cancer free and running and playing and laughing with God and all of the other precious children.
Last year she wrote to her local paper to ask members of the public to send Danny a card because he loved receiving them.
At the time she said: This is unbelievable. Were going to be opening these for a long time.

Its an idyllic Caribbean island thats been long associated with da erb, thanks to musicians such as reggae legend Bob Marley.
But the first legal Cannabis plant has now been planted in Jamaica, on the grounds of a University campus.
The University of the West Indies has been authorised by the Jamaican government to cultivate marijuana for medical research, but more significantly to set the pace the development of a legal cannabis industry.
The new development for Marijuana in the country comes across the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015, which hopes to develop a medical marijuana industry in the country.
And a similar license will also be granted to Jamaicas University of Technology.
Jamaicas Science Minister Philip Paulwell said the trial could pave the way for the commercialisation of Cannabis.
I want to know when you start to do the experimentation, and what is found in the plant, he said

Drone footage over the Nepalese capital shows widespread destruction in the wake of an earthquake.
A 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit this weekend has so far taken the lives of nearly 4,000 people from Nepal, India, Tibet and Bangladesh. As many as 7,000 people are believed to be injured.
And footage recorded by a drone over Kathmandu shows widespread destruction in the Nepalese capital, wherehomes have been eitherpartially or completely destroyedand huge cracks are visible in the roads and streets.
People can be seen gathering in the squares, unsure of what to do.
Charities and NGOs are sending teams and medical assistance to the country, where shortages of food and water and aloss of electricity havecreated a humanitarian crisis.

Whats worse than finding a worm in your sandwich? Half a worm.
Or two worms, which is what Joyce Fedd claims to have discovered in her McChicken sandwich.
According to Ms. Fedd, she ordered thefood for her two children from the McDonalds drive-through in Jacksonville, Florida.
But she said that when she looked closer atone of the McChicken sandwiches she discovered a purple worm. And then another.
McDonalds quickly offered a refund for the sandwiches and issued a statement.

Food safety is a top priority and we take incidents such as this very seriously, as it is highly unusual, Jim Van Laere, the McDonalds owner and operator, told Action News Jacksonville.
We quickly reviewed our entire kitchen to ensure this type of occurrence could not happen.
McDonalds told Action News that the chicken didnt come from them but from an independent distributor. Ms. Fedd wasnt convinced.
Theres no telling what else is in those sandwiches, she said.
If it came from the shipping, I am pretty sure its not just one chicken sandwich.

Good-looking men are less likely to succeed in job interviews because theyre seen as a threat, studyfinds
Harry Readhead for Metro.co.uk Monday 27 Apr 2015 2:10 pm
Attractive men can be perceived as a threat by employers (Picture: Giphy)
Struggling to find a job? Devilishly attractive? Well the two may be linked.
Thats according to a new studyfromthe University of Maryland, where researchers discovered that male attractiveness can be a disadvantage when it comes to job interviews.
According to assistant professor Marko Pitesa, handsome men intimidate employers, who see them as a potential threat.
The research team did find, however, that if the interviewer was told he would be working alongside the interviewee  rather than have the interviewee working for him  attractive men were favoured.
MORE: Bad-back sufferers have chimpanzee vertebrae, study finds
Looking like this has its advantages although you may be seen as a threat for other reasons (Picture: Giphy)
241 adults were asked to evaluate fictional job candidates based on fake qualifications and experience with men assessing men and women assessing women.
Fictional candidates came with computer-generated headshots that were either attractive or unattractive.
A second experiment involved 92 people, who were asked to evaluate competitors or partners in a quiz game. Again, headshots ranging in attractiveness were used and the same pattern of discrimination was seen.
In another test, women judged men and men judged women, and in a final experiment, actual student candidates were used. In both cases, people opted to work with attractive men but compete against unattractive men.
The way we explain it here, pretty men just seem more competent, so it is actually subjectively rational to discriminate for or against them, Pitesa said.

Got a bad back? Youre probably a bit like this guy
If youre constantly suffering from back pain, then youve got a kindred spirit in hairy tree-swinging primates.
Thats according to a new study, which suggested that those who suffer from back pain may have vertebrae similar to those of chimpanzees.
The study by scientists in Canada found that humans suffering from a common form of vertical slipped disc had vertebrae closer in shape to those of the playful apes.
And evolution could also come into play, as the study suggested that we went from walking on all fours to upright on two legs a little too quickly, leaving some humans slightly vulnerable to bad backs.
Dr Kimberly Plomp from Simon Fraser University, who lead the study, said: Our study is the first to use quantitative methods to uncover why humans are so commonly afflicted with back problems compared to non-human primates.
The findings have potential implications for clinical research as they indicate why some individuals are more prone to back problems.
The team compared the vertebrae from 71 humans, 36, chimpanzees and 15 rorang-utans and found that the vertebrae of humans with a slipped disc, otherwise known as Schmorls nodes, bore a resemblance to that of chimpanzees.
MORE: Three young women are the first in the world to be jailed for twerking
Slipped discs occur when the cartilage pads between vertebrae split, and release a gel-like substance, that subsequently puts a significant amount of pressure on spinal nerves.
Its not clear what the cause of the cripplingly painful back injury is, but age has previously been suggested to be a factor, as spinal discs before less flexible with age and are more likely to rupture.

A bakery has been ordered to pay $135,000 (89,000) in damages to a lesbian coupleafter refusing to make them a same-sex wedding cake.
Aaron and Melissa Klein, who own Sweet Cakes by Melissa in Oregon, were found to have violated the states anti-discrimination laws when they refused to make a care for the wedding of Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer in 2013.
And the Kleins, who say they refused the couple service on religious grounds, have been ordered to pay $135,000 (89,000).

The law provides an exemption for religious organisations and schools, but does not allow private businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation, just as they cannot legally deny service based on race, sex, age, disability or religion, said Charlie Burr, a spokesman for the Oreogn Bureau of Labour and Industries.
The State Labour Commisioner will review the ruling and make a final decision on the damages.
A GoFundMe page started to help the bakery pay off the fine was shut down by the site afterreceiving $100,000 in donations, with administrators saying it was raising money for illegal purposes, according to the Sweet Cakes by Melissa Facebook page.
The bakery has now said that donations can be made through the Samaritans Purse, a Christian organisation.

It certainly looks like it. This weeks Lidl catalogue appears to include a young girl enjoying a tasty mouthful of flower.
Which is slightly surprising.
This is the greatest thing I've seen all year. Random child eating a flower in a Lidl catalogue! http://t.co/3tzfLxlrHx
 Gavin Somers (@gaviiins) April 27, 2015
But whats more surprising than the picture itself is that apparently no-one at Lidl noticed. Or if they did notice, they didnt think there was any issue with publishing it in the catalogue.
The other theory is that perhaps they took a selection of photos of these children and that was the best one. Which begs the question: what was wrong withthe other photos?

If youre one of those people that struggles just to complete a Rubiks Cube, this makes for humbling watching.
A teenager shaved a full 0.3 seconds off the record for solving a Rubiks Cube this weekend.
Collin Burns completed the cube in a frankly-ridiculous 5.25 seconds at the World Cube Association competition in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, beating the previous record of 5.55 seconds, which was set by Dutchman Mats Valk in 2013.

Ridiculous. (Picture: YouTube)
We can confirm that this is the new official WCA world record for the 3x3x3 single solve category, a spokesman told Mashable .
To our best knowledge, it has been performed in an official competition, with all the rules being followed, even the scramble has been checked for its correctness.
We humans still have some way to go before we become the fastest cube-solving thing, however. A LEGO Cubestormer robot managed to solve a Rubiks Cube in just 3.2 seconds last year.

Trying to fit a video camera on the dorsal fin of a great white shark in a small inflatable dingy is never the safest thing to do.
What happened next to this crew is scary to say the least. A great white shark can be seen tryingto chomp through the rope tetheringthe dingy from its mother boat.
Meanwhile, the two-man crew of the dingy have the rather unsettling experience of feeling the massive ocean predator rockingthe boat every time it swam underneath and around it.
Heard in the footage, someone says: Its a little nerve-racking being in a boat no bigger than the size of the shark. The shark is actually bigger than our boat.

This incident took place as a peaceful protest in Baltimore about the death of a black man, Freddie Gray, due to critical injuries in police custody turned violent.
Thousands of people had marched on the citys downtown streets before violent behaviour took place leading to 34 arrests with six officers suffering minor injuries.

        <Description>So you work on an isolated space station in a low orbit of Earth, why not watch a film about a space shuttle being destroyed by debris?

Gravity is perhaps a surprising choice of film for an astronaut (Picture: Warner Bros)
If you were an astronaut in space, what would you watch?
Something which reminded you of home? Or perhaps a film following the devastating consequences of a disaster in space?
If youre astronaut Scott Kelly, its the latter.
While you might think Gravity would be a bit too close to home for astronauts on board the International Space Station, it seems it was the perfect Saturday night viewing.
Kelly wrote on Twitter: #Movie night in micro #Gravity aboard #ISS on our new HD projector which we use for conferences, tech software, etc..

The Oscar-winning film, which stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, sees the pair stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle mid-orbit.
With the ISS featuring in the film, many Twitter users remarked that it was a slightly brave choiceto watch in space.
One commented that it was like watching Titanic on the Titanic, while another thought it was like watching Jaws while treading water.
Given that Kelly is spending an entire year in space with cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko, we doubt he was phased by one slightly scary film.

Hes usually preoccupied with writing world-changing speeches in his capacity as President of the United States.
But Barack Obama showed his funny bone and let off some steam last night as he delivered a speech at the White House Correspondents Dinner.

The annual event is renowned for featuring a light-hearted address by the President, and last nights speech saw the president firing some humorous jabs at his political opponents.
A few weeks ago Dick Cheney said he thinks Im the worst president of his lifetime, which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime, he quipped.
He also invited American comedian Keegan-Michael Key onstage, to recreate a sketch about Luther, Obamas anger translator, who translated the presidents mild-mannered address into angry thoughts.
Funny, but not quite as great as the Correspondents Dinner in 2011  when Obama addressed critics who claimed that he wasnt born in America.

Kimberly Pappas has been charged with murder and child abuse
A woman has been charged with murder after she gave birth at work and then allegedly tried to hide the infant by shoving it inside her desk drawer.
Kimberly Pappas, 25, allegedly used cuticle scissors to sever the umbilical cord of her new-born son, after giving birth in the office bathroom, according to the Detroit Free Press.
She then shoved the infant into a sealed plastic bag and concealed him inside her desk for about 30 minutes.
But police were called after concerned co-workers heard groaning in the bathroom and discovered a pool of blood in the toilet cubicle.
Pappas reportedly told police that she had suffered a miscarriage, but an autopsy declared the babys death a murder  and determined that the infant had died from suffocation shortly after birth.

If youre in desperate need of a home, throwing a mangoat David Camerons head wont get you very far.
But the President of Venezuela feels differently.
Nicols Maduro was pelted with the tasty fruit as he travelled through Aragua in a bus.
A message had been scrawled onto the mango byMarleny Olivo, who told the president of her housing plight.
To her surprise, the 52-year-old displayed it on live TV and promised her a new home as part of a housing mission.
Maduro said: Marleny Olivo had a problem with her house. Wecalled her. She was scared. She couldnt believe it was true.
Ive approved an apartment for you, Marleny, as part of the Grand Venezuelan Housing Mission.
He also promised to eat the mango.

If youre in your early 40s, have regular pangs to own a really fast car and feel like life didnt workout for you, then youre probably having a midlife crisis.
Music giant Spotify believes it has pin-pointed the average age of midlife crises as 42.
Staff analysed data and found that users aged around 42 drop their usual playlists  which usually contain hits from their youth  in favour of todays cult bangers from the likes of Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.
Research suggested that young 20-something tend to listen to chart music. But during the late 20s and early 30s our taste changes as we attempt to broaden our musical horizons outside of chart tracks.
Chart shows popularity of music against age (Picture: Spotify)
But by 35 most adults stop caring about keeping up with music all together, apparently.
Then, at 42, we burst back onto the music scene with a thirst for pop.
Groovy.

Xie Xu gives Zhang Chi a piggy back (Picture: Facebook)
A kind-hearted schoolboy in China has spent three years giving piggybacks to his disabled best friend  to ensure that he doesnt miss any of his lessons.
Zhang Chi, 19, suffers from muscular dystrophy, a condition that affects skeletal muscle, and makes it extremely hard to walk.
But best friend Xie Xu, 18, has spent the last three years carrying him around the corridors of Daxu High School, in Xuzhou, northern China.
(Picture: Facebook)
The pair live in dorms close to the school, and Xie also carries Zhang to school every day, while also helping with daily tasks such as cooking and washing clothes.
Speaking to Shanghaiist, vice-principal Guo Chunxi hailed the pairs story as inspiring.
The pair also eat lunch together (Picture: Facebook)
The story of the two students is so inspiring and touching, he said.
They arent family but Xie has been doing this for three years.
And he described Xie Xu as a beautiful student.

Toothbrushes will be able to diagnose cancer and Alzheimers in the near future, experts claim.
Its thanks to a giant leap forward in microchip technology.
Nanopore sequencers, to be more specific, can decode DNA into a digital format and can be compared with genetic makers which are known to indicate disease.
Health experts believe the vision will soon become a reality because the sequencers are being produced smaller and smaller. Eventually, theyll be the right size to embed into any product or device.
The sequencers have already been used to help test for Ebola in Africa.
Clive Brown, chief technology officer at Oxford Nanopore, told the Wired Health medical technology conference the sequences could become ubiquitous sensing apparatus capable of monitoring our health.

A man weighing over 500kg was hoisted onto a truck by a crane and moved to hospital after his nursing home was forced to shut.
Robert Butler, from Providence, Rhode Island, was transported on Sunday  after the Bannister House care home was forced to shut due to crippling debts.
But despite the journey being just eight miles, it took seven hours for crews to remove him from the four-storey building and take him to hospital.
Local health official Michael Raia explained that a co-ordinated approach had been needed to transport him.
Picture: YouTube/Local 12
This is a patient with very complicated medical needs and its required a coordinated approach across state government, he told WJAR-TV.
His care and safety has been our top priority throughout this transport.

Butler was initially transferred to the home almost a decade ago, as he attempted to lose weight in order to medically qualify for gastric bypass surgery.
But during his time at the home, he never lost the weight and instead piled on 300kgs.
And he was refused treatment under Medicaid, an American social health care program for low income citizens.

Its odd because the government will give me money to survive every month but they wont help me to get off disability, Butler said in 2006.
I want to work. I want to start a career again. Im willing to chance dying on that operating table instead of dying in this bed.

The horse meat scandal exploded in 2013(Picture: FancyDressCostumes)
European authorities say police in several countries have detained 26 people in a crackdown on an organised crime network accused of trading in illegal horse meat.
Eurojust, the EU agency for judicial co-operation, said in a statement late Friday that the network falsified documents and sold meat from horses unfit for human consumption.
The meat then made its way into the legal food chain, unbeknownst to consumers.
The operation involved authorities in France, Belgium, Britain, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The statement said the main suspect is a Belgian, but did not provide the nationalities of those arrested.
European health authorities have been on alert for horse meat crime since 2013, when they discovered that it was being secretly sold as beef in some prepared foods around Europe.

These are the faces of some of the British people caught up in the Nepal earthquake horror.
Among them is a couple who were celebrating their honeymoon on Mount Everest (top right) whenhavea 7.9 magnitude earthquake shook the region yesterday  leaving nearly 2,000 dead and around 70 Brits unaccounted for.
In a blog post , Alex Schneider and Sam Chappatte told of the terrifying moment they saw an avalanche coming towards them before snow battered the camp and buried tents.
Sam witnessed similar horror last year when he arrived in Base Camp in the immediate aftermath of last years avalanche which claimed the lives of16 guides and triggered an unprecedented shut-down of the worlds highest peak.

Alex and Sam's full blog post
The earthquake hit about 30 minutes after we had crossed the icefall yesterday morning and found our tents. The ground started shaking violently but before we could react Dan was shouting Get out of your f****** tents, grab your ice axes!.
We staggered out to see an avalanche coming straight at us. A blast of wind knocked us down but we were able to get up and run to shelter behind some tents and anchor ourselves with our axes.
The wind was so strong that Pat was knocked down and pivoted on his axe. We focused on keeping an air hole so we could breathe in the powder.
Dan was fantastic, shouting directions at us, keeping us together and strong. Our tents were only lightly covered so we dug them out and moved them into the middle of the valley. There are about 30 of us here in Camp 1 and the same again in Camp 2.
Then the wait began because it was snowing and we didnt know what was happening.
Didnt sleep too well last night but this morning it is glorious sunshine and we can see for miles around. The views are incredible and we can see the summit clearly.
No-one knows how bad the damage to the Icefall route down is yet, but we have heard that our part of Basecamp has been flattened.
There is talk of possibly hiking up to Camp 2 but for the moment we are acclimatising and waiting.
Helicopters have been in to pick up the sick and injured. Were OK. Weve got food and the sherpas are being amazing. Were OK.

Earlier today, a powerfulearthquake aftershock struck India and Nepal, shaking buildings in New Delhi and triggering an avalanche in the Himalayas.
The United States Geological Survey said the tremor was 6.7 magnitude.
The death toll is expected to rise and rescuers continue sifting through rubble today.

They had to use pick axes because bulldozers could not get through the ancient citys narrow streets.
In Everests worst disaster, the bodies of 17 climbers were recovered from the mountain on Sunday after being caught in avalanches. A plane carrying the first 15 injured climbers landed at Kathmandu airport at around noon local time.
There is a lot of confusion on the mountain, said Gelu Sherpa. The toll will rise.

Meanwhile, officials in Nepal are gathering up bodies for a mass cremation.

Anyone whos seen the original Star Wars trilogy will remember the scene where the droid R2-D2 projects a hologram of Princess Leia saying Help us, Obi Wan Kenobi youre my only hope.
At the time, 3D holograms visible with the naked eye only belonged to the realmof science fiction.
But not any more. Scientists at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, have found how to createfull-colour, pop-up, floating 3D displays that can be seen without glasses.
Study authors Min Gu and Xiangping Litweaked the refractive index of graphene oxide to create the effect.

Hologram displays may be available for wearable technology within five years(Picture: AP)
As Science Alert reports, Holograms work by bending light off the screen in a carefully controlled way so that, instead of bouncing directly back into your eye, it makes it appear as though its projected off a separate display.
The Swinburne researchers were able to create the floating 3D display by tweaking the refractive index  the measure of how much light bends as it passes through a medium  of graphene oxide. This allowed them to create tiny, nanoscale pixels that make up floating 3D images, visible to the naked eye.
So far, the team have only created holograms up to 1cm, but they say that scaling up is easy.
It is projected that graphene 3D display at tens of centimetre scale, perfect for the wearable displaying devices, will be available within five years, The Conversation reports.

A mum is suing police who she claims stripped and photographed her 20-year-old daughters body after she was killed in a car crash.
Christina Mejia has filed a lawsuit against police and is set to appear in court next week.
She says officers removed her daughter Jessicas t-shirt, jeans and high heels before taking crime scene pictures in the aftermath of the fatal crash on New Years Eve 2009.
Mrs Mejia is suing police for emotional distress and says the actions of officers led to false rumours Jessica had been on top of boyfriend Nicholas Sord when they smashed into a pole in Illinois, US.
She told the Chicago Tribune : This was a young lady that just died and was treated with less dignity than a deer carcass you find on the side of the road.
People think my daughter died from having sex. By the time everybody else got to the scene, she was partially naked because they made her naked.
I dont feel protected. I feel violated.
Jessica, a psychology student at a local university, was photographed in clothes before the semi-naked shots of her body were taken.
Sord, who was three times the drink-drive limit, pleaded guilty to drink driving and was jailed for four years and eight months.

Sheriffs Office spokeswoman Cara Smith said the family suffered an unimaginable loss.
But she added the crime scene photos were taken as our officers investigated this crime and were instrumental in securing a conviction against the person responsible for this tragic death.
In no way were these photos intended to cause harm to the family.

An avalanche triggered by a massive earthquake in Nepal smashed into a base camp at the foothills of Mount Everest today, killing at least 18climbers and guides.
Many others were injured and an unknown number have been reported as missing near the mountains most dangerous spot, officials said.
Others have been reported buried in their tents and there are chaotic scenes as climbers help injured colleagues including one who has broken two legs.

A steady flow of people are fleeing the base camp for more secure areas down the mountain.
The avalanche struck between the Khumbu Icefall, a notoriously treacherous rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and the base for most expeditions.
Sean James, a 44-year-old British man who lives in Dubai, was at the north side of Everest base camp.
He told Daily Telegraph: I am a professional climber  Ive been in the mountains a few times with avalanches, but not one this big.

Chinese media reported a Chinese climber and two Sherpa guides were among the dead though the nationalities of the rest are still unknown.
Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured, said Danish climber Carsten Lillelund.

We carry out severely injured people. This is pretty tough and heavy. We do not know whether there will be more avalanches, Mr Glomnes Johansen
All those who are unharmed organise help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here.

John William Clements was unhappy the threesome didnt happen (Picture: Supplied)
A man committed a murder suicide after he found out a planned threesome wasnt happening.
John William Clements made the drastic decision when an arrangement with girlfriend Helen Scott and former lover Kylie Hales fell through, according to a coroners report.
The 46-year-olds former partner had decided to spend the night with her ex-husband instead and when she returned to her home in Devonport, Tasmania, Mr Clements assaulted her.
After fetching a gun from his home Clementsreturned and shot dead a friend of Ms Hales, Benjamin Mark Aherne, 30, who she had called for help.
He then turned the gun on himself, the Mercury reports .
Mr Clements had also shot his girlfriend Ms Rowland but she survived.
The incident happened in October 2011 but the findings of an inquest were published on Wednesday at Launceston Magistrates Court.
His expectation of sexual gratification by means of the proposed threesome was disappointed either shortly before or immediately after he entered the bedroom, said coroner Michael Brett.

Got a song stuck in your head? Just chew gum.
So say scientists at the University of Reading, who found that people who chew gum are less likely to think about sticky songs and less likely to hear them after theyve stopped.
A study showed that at least 90 percent of people experience earworms, with 15 percent of people calling them disturbing.
Subjects in the study were played Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5. They were told to hit a key when they thought about the songs and those who were chewing gum hit the key a lot less than those who werent.
If youd like to test this theory, here are some catchy songs. Feeling brave?

Now were not condoning this suspects behaviour, but he surely deserves some credit for the way he escaped house arrest.
Diego Martinez-Espinoza, who was held at his home on drug charges, is thought to haveslipped past authorities, escaped the state and perhaps even left the country by putting his court-ordered GPS ankle monitoron his cat.
Martinez-Espinoza was charged in a Virginia state court with alleged felony narcotics conspiracy after allegedly trying to distribute19kg of cocaine on New Years Eve.

The 23-year-old was granted bond on the provision that he wore an ankle monitor so his whereabouts could be tracked.
When Martinez-Espinoza failed to respond to orders to call police sent through the tracker, his landlord entered the apartment  and found the cat wearing the GPS as a collar.
The suspect was nowhere to be seen.

NOTE: In an emergency always call 999
This video could save your life one day.
The standard method to save someoneslife if they are choking is to use the Heimlich Maneuvre.
However, the Heimlich Maneuvre requires two people. So what would you do if you were on your own?
Jeff Rehman, a firefighter and paramedic based in the USA, thinks he hasthe answer.
The former boxersuggests first getting on your hands and knees.
Next he says to drop down onto your chest to push the air in your lungs out.
He suggests this burst of air from your diaphragm should help force the thing that is lodged in your throat out.
Or at least move it to enable you to breath.
Rehman says he developed the technique from an exercise he used to use during his boxing days  back in the 1980s.
